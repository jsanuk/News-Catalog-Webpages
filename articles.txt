The dismissal by a senior Ukrainian official on Tuesday came in response to a report by the New York Times, which cited new intelligence that had been reviewed by United States officials. “Although I enjoy collecting amusing conspiracy theories about (the Ukrainian) government, I have to say: (Ukraine) has nothing to do with the Baltic Sea mishap and has no information about ‘pro-(Ukraine) sabotage groups,’” Mykhailo Podolyak, top adviser to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, wrote on Twitter.

      "content": " The number of young children in the US who have died from opioid overdoses has increased significantly, according to a new study on accidental poisonings of children 5 and younger. The study, published Wednesday in the journal Pediatrics, looked at a nationwide database and found 731 children 5 and under among poison-related fatalitiesbetween 2005 and 2018. Some of the children were poisoned by over-the-counter pain, cold and allergy medicines, but the highest number of fatal poisonings by far were from opioids. The trend got worse over time. In 2005, opioids accounted for 24.1% (seven of 29) of the substances contributing to child deaths, compared with 52.2% (24 of 46) in 2018. “It truly is striking to see, looking at this data, how different the proportions were between 2005 and 2018,” said study co-author Dr. Christopher Gaw, an associate fellow at Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia whose research primarily focuses on pediatric injury and poisoning. Gaw thinks that people’s preferences for particular drugs have shifted and that that has had an impact on fatality numbers. In the late 1990s and early 2000s, prescription-based opioids were the drug of choice. As guidelines became stricter and more doctors and dentists became aware of the opioid epidemic, they prescribed fewer opioids, so people turned to things like heroin and fentanyl. Illicitly used drugs like fentanyl, which is 100 times stronger than morphine and can kill quickly, don’t come in childproof packaging.",

In December, federal health officials announced that, starting January 5, the US would require all travelers from China to show a negative Covid test result before flying to the country after Beijing’s rapid easing of Covid restrictions led to a surge in cases. The source said the order was put in place in an effort to protect US citizens following “a large wave of infections in the PRC,” coupled with “a lack of transparency” by Chinese officials surrounding the surge. The Biden administration still plans to monitor cases in China and around the world, keeping in place a Traveler-based Genomic Surveillance (TGS) program that surveys travelers on details around new variants.",

They can’t go wrong with me.” The Emmy-winner said on the podcast that she’s wanted to go by the name of Suzy since she was 10 years old. At the time, she said, she thought “no this is not going to happen.” Once Izzard’s Hollywood career began picking up, she said she felt like she couldn’t “redo” what her public-facing name had already become. “And then I thought well, if I’m doing she/her, why don’t I add that to the name? Because I’ve got ‘Edward’ on my passport, it’s quite wooden and big and I don’t call myself that. So, I just thought I’ll add Suzy there, and then Eddie, and people can choose what they want and no one can go wrong,” she said. Izzard came out as transgender in the 1980s. She started using the pronouns she/her in 2019 after the chancellor for Swansea University referred to Izzard with those pronouns during a ceremony in which she was presented with an honorary degree. She explained that “it felt amazing” to hear herself referred to as “she/her” and adopted the pronouns as her own thereafter. Izzard has had a decades-long career in film and television appearing in the “Ocean’s 11” films and NBC’s “Hannibal” series, among many other titles, in addition to her stand-up comedy work. Outside of Hollywood, Izzard is a member of the UK’s Labour Party and is a dedicated political activist.",

In remarks at a Morgan Stanley Conference, Musk laid out his vision to boost Twitter’s core advertising business by adopting the standard strategy of most of the company’s peers: improving the relevance of the ads it serves. “The advertising relevance is the most gigantic thing,” Musk said. “And this is going to sound totally bizarre, but Twitter did not consider relevance in advertising until three months ago.” With that change, and larger cost cuts across the organization, Musk said he believes Twitter has “got a shot at being cash flow positive next quarter.” “Going forward, Twitter will have very relevant, useful advertising,” Musk said. “And because it is useful, because it is relevant, there will be a massive increase in revenue, because it is now useful. So I’m very optimistic about the future. It’s been a very difficult four months, but I’m optimistic about the future.” Since taking over the platform in late October, Twitter has suffered a mass exodus of top brands as Musk relaxed some content moderation policies, restored incendiary accounts and made a number of erratic remarks concerning politics and world affairs. Musk, who has previously tweeted about his hatred for advertising, made a quick bet on bolstering a paid subscription offering instead, but it has reportedly struggled to gain traction. He also took the time to thank advertisers that have stuck with Twitter throughout his rocky takeover, including Disney and Apple.",

The majority comes from land, swept into rivers – by rain, wind, overflowing storm drains and littering – and transported out to sea. A smaller but still significant amount, such as fishing gear, is lost or simply dumped into the ocean. Once plastic gets into the ocean, it doesn’t decompose but instead tends to break down into tiny pieces. These particles “are really not easily cleaned up, we’re stuck with them,” Erdle said. Marine life can get entangled in plastic or mistake it for food. Plastic can also leach toxic chemicals into the water. And it isn’t just an environmental disaster; plastic is also a huge climate problem. Fossil fuels are the raw ingredient for most plastics, and they produce planet-heating pollution throughout their lifecycle – from production to disposal. Plastic pollution on a beach in Honduras. The Ocean Cleanup Figuring out exactly how much plastic is in the ocean is a hard exercise. “The ocean is a complex place. There are lots of ocean currents, there are changes over time due to weather and due to conditions on the ground,” Erdle said.",

      "content": " The Chinese government could use TikTok to control data on millions of people and harness the short-form video app to shape public opinion should China invade Taiwan, FBI Director Christopher Wray told the Senate Intelligence Committee Wednesday. Wray responded affirmatively to questions from Republican Sen. Marco Rubio of Florida, the panel’s ranking member, on whether TikTok would allow Beijing widespread control over data and a valuable influence tool in the event of war in the Taiwan Strait. “The most fundamental piece that cuts across every one of those risks and threats that you mentioned that I think Americans need to understand is that something that’s very sacred in our country —the difference between the private sector and public sector — that’s a line that is nonexistent in the way that the CCP [Chinese Communist Party] operates,” Wray told Rubio in the hearing. Rubio, the top Republican on the Senate panel, argued that TikTok presents “a substantial national security threat for the country of a kind that we didn’t face in the past.” Wray’s comments come a day after Gen. Paul Nakasone, head of the US National Security Agency, told the Senate Armed Services Committee that he worried TikTok could censor videos to shape public opinion in a way that threatens US national security interests. It’s the latest in a full-court press from US officials to sound the alarm about TikTok’s alleged security risks as Congress weighs giving the Biden administration more authority to address the alleged threat posed by the platform, up to and including banning the app in the United States TikTok CEO Shou Chew said this week that the Chinese government has “never asked us for US user data” and the company would not provide it if the government did ask. Chew also said that “misinformation and propaganda has no place on our platform, and our users do not expect that.”",

By Rebecca Day, CNN Underscored Updated\n9:28 AM EST, Wed March 8, 2023 Link Copied! iStock If you’ve spent any time looking for a new TV, you’ve probably already heard of 8K — which claims to offer the highest resolution picture you can get. Coming straight on the heels of recent upgrades to picture quality, 8K Ultra HD TV is indeed a ground-breaking new format, offering a whopping four times the resolution of 4K. The problem is, not only are these new 8K TVs considerably more expensive than their 4K brethren, there is also virtually no 8K content available to view on them yet. Mike Fidler, executive director of the 8K Association, says current 8K models are ideal for any AV enthusiast interested in “the ultimate entertainment experience.” But, as we saw when HDTV first came out in the late 1990’s, hardware typically hits the market well before the content. In fact, even though 4K Ultra HD TVs have been selling for about a decade, 4K content is still catching up.",

      "content": " Ring’s got a new battery-powered video doorbell camera that promises some major upgrades, including an improved field-of-view and the highest resolution video available in any wireless Ring doorbell. The $180 Ring Battery Doorbell Plus is available to preorder today, with deliveries scheduled to kick off in about a month, on April 5. Arguably the most noticeable improvement Ring made to the new Battery Doorbell Plus is the new 150 x 150 degree field-of-view that provides a 1:1 aspect ratio feed of who or what’s near your front door. That’s a big upgrade from the existing battery doorbell’s 155 x 90 degree field of view. Ring refers to this as a head-to-toe view because it provides an expanded look that now includes your porch or front steps immediately in front of the camera, whereas in the past that may have been an area that was cut off. And because the camera can now see immediately below it, you’ll be able to use Ring’s package alerts (Ring Protect subscription required) to mark the area where deliveries are usually left, allowing the camera to monitor for packages and alert you through the mobile app. Alongside the larger field of view, Ring also bumped up the video resolution from 1080p on the current crop of battery doorbells to 1536p. The increase in resolution should lead to clearer, cleaner video clips both in the live stream view and with recorded clips. The Battery Doorbell Plus will be sold alongside Ring’s Video Doorbell 3 while supplies last, after which the Battery Doorbell Plus will take its spot in Ring’s video doorbell lineup. Ring",

That means picking out the best layers for the most warmth, like fleece-lined leggings and sweaters, and choosing a reliable down jacket to fend off chilly temperatures. It also means finding the best gloves or mittens to keep your hands warm to prevent unexpected injuries like frostbite or frostnip. With average daily highs in the low 30s, Minnesotans have figured out what gear works best to keep you warm — and the team behind Frost River, a locally owned outdoor gear company based in Duluth, are no strangers to staying warm in winter weather. One of my favorite pieces of winter gear by the brand is the Frost River Northern Pacific mittens.

      "content": " Phones, chargers and cords, oh my! These days, travel isn’t as simple as a carry-on bag and a checked piece of luggage. Today’s travelers are bogged down with cords, chargers, smartphones and more tech that inadvertently gets lost, tangled, misplaced or — worst of all — broken in transit. Rather than just stuffing cumbersome laptop and phone chargers, adapters and cables into a purse, backpack or laptop bag, keep it all organized with a travel cord organizer designed specifically for tech accessories. Before you buy, consider how much gear you actually travel with. If it’s just you, a laptop and a phone, you can skip the ones with all the bells and whistles and multiple compartments, and instead opt for a simple zip enclosure kit. But if you travel with kids or your partner is constantly misplacing their tech, having lots of roomy pouches and pockets that accommodate multiple accessories ensures there’s space for everyone’s must-haves. Ultimately, having a dedicated spot for your tech accessories makes the travel experience more stress-free — and who’s opposed to that? Make travel easier and tech more accessible with any one of our 21 favorite travel cable and tech organizers. Padded for protection and just 1.5 inches thick, the Calpak Tech Organizer has multiple pockets for cords, chargers, phones and headphones, with mesh panels that make it easy to see what’s stored inside. Plus, elastic pockets and loops make it easy to access certain items. All of your tech accessories can fit inside this zipper-enclosed pouch, which also has a carrying handle and exterior mesh pocket. Choose from eight shades and patterns that coordinate with Calpak’s packing cubes and luggage. It should come as no surprise that the travel pros at Away have come up with a solution for tech equipment. The Away Tech Case is split into two compartments: A larger, zippered mesh one for laptop chargers and bulkier items and a smaller one for cords, earbuds and other smaller accessories. Elastic loops keep everything secure, so you don’t have to worry about anything spilling out. Away's Tech Case is available in three colors to match your favorite piece of Away luggage. And, for an extra $20, you can personalize it with three embroidered letters, making it a great gift item for the frequent traveler in your life. With a translucent shell that makes it easy to see everything stored inside, this Tech Kit will keep you from blindly searching through your bags ever again. A crush-proof outer shell with full zipper closure provides protection so you don’t have to worry if your luggage gets tossed around during transit. Inside, there’s an interior separator with elastic cable organizers and a pocket with enough room for hard drives, power banks, wireless headphones and SD cards. For a quirky take on personalization, you can upload a photo of your pet and the company will print it on the kit for you to take your furry friend along on your next vacation. The folks at Monos know a thing or two about creating a travel essential — and this Folio Kit is no exception. Available in seven chic colorways, not only does this folio have room for credit cards and a key ring, but it's also got dedicated spots for your tech essentials. Inside, you'll find several elastic loops for charging cords and pens as well as a zippered pocket for smaller items. There are also dedicated pouches that can fit SD cards, travel documents and even space for an e-reader or tablet.",

      "content": " IMF chief: Ukraine war will have ‘devastating’ consequences for Russia’s economy The International Monetary Fund has drawn criticism for forecasting that Russia will see stronger economic growth this year than either the United Kingdom or Germany, despite rising pressure from Western sanctions. “When you take our projections over a medium term, what they mean is Russia[’s economy] shrinking by at least 7%,” Georgieva said in an interview that aired Wednesday. In January, the IMF projected that Russia’s economy would expand by 0.3% this year and 2.1% the next. That was much more optimistic than the latest forecasts from both the World Bank and the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development. Economists at those groups have penciled in contractions of 3.3% and 5.6% in 2023, respectively. Even Russia’s own central bank, which extended emergency capital controls for another six months on Monday, has said gross domestic product might contract by 1% this year. Jeffrey Sonnenfeld, a Yale management professor, wrote in Fortune magazine Monday that the “IMF has been asleep at the switch” and parroting propaganda from Russian President Vladimir Putin. “With respect to Russia, it is naively echoing Putin’s own invented GDP forecasts, in effect, canonizing and legitimating these economic myths with no verification,” said Sonnenfeld and two colleagues, Stephen Roach and Steven Tian.",

      "content": " In January, some pharmacy chains announced plans to distribute mifepristone to patients with prescriptions, following a US Food and Drug Administration policy change permitting the direct sale of the abortion drug by certified pharmacies. Mary Zeigler Bill Lax/Bill Lax/FSU Photography Service Just a few months later, one of the country’s biggest pharmacy retailers, Walgreens, abruptly announced that it wouldn’t distribute mifepristone in 21 Republican-controlled states. On Tuesday, Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom said in a tweet that the state of California “won’t be doing business” with the chain, “or any company that cowers to the extremists and puts women’s lives at risk.” Walgreens told NPR in a statement on Friday that it’s working to sell the drug in “jurisdictions where it is legal and operationally feasible.” One reason Walgreens’ move is so stunning is because the states where the company has decided not to make the drug available include several which have legalized abortion or protected it under their state constitution—including Florida, Kansas and Montana. In Florida, Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis has pledged to sign a ban on abortion at six weeks, but nothing has crossed his desk yet and abortion remains legal in the state until 15 weeks. In Kansas and Montana, voters last year rejected ballot initiatives eroding abortion rights. None of that seemed to make any difference to Walgreens. Nor did it matter that no lawsuit has been filed challenging the sale of the abortion medication. The warning of potential legal action was enough to make the company backtrack.",

      "content": " On February 2, Curiosity observed rays of sunlight stretching across the horizon and illuminating a bank of clouds as the sun set on Mars. It’s the first time the rays, known as crepuscular rays, have been seen so clearly on the red planet. The rover is conducting a survey of twilight clouds on Mars to follow up on its previous observations of night-shining clouds. In 2021, Curiosity used its black and white navigation cameras to watch the structure of those clouds as they moved on Mars. Clouds provide deeper insight about weather patterns and conditions. Scientists can use information about when and where clouds form on Mars to learn more about the planet’s atmospheric composition and temperatures, as well as wind. The new survey, which kicked off in January and will wrap up later this month, utilizes the rover’s color camera located on its mast to watch as cloud particles grow. On Mars, most clouds are made of frozen ice and float about 37 miles (60 kilometers) above the ground. But Curiosity spotted clouds that reach a higher altitude, as seen in the new photo, leading researchers to believe they are made of frozen carbon dioxide ice — or dry ice. Scientists are still studying them to figure out why this happens. The Curiosity rover captured this feather-shaped iridescent cloud just after sunset on January 27. NASA/JPL-Caltech/MSSS",

Nolen defended his agency’s handling of the safety incidents, some of which were averted when pilots – not the air traffic controllers from his agency – avoided a collision. He said officials are “treating each of these as if it had been an actual event.” “The FAA absolutely has a grasp on the situation and it’s something that we look at every day,” Nolen told reporters. “We’ll take a look at these near misses and see if there are lessons to be learned.” He said a major safety meeting next week will include industry officials and ask the “hard questions.” “Let’s just stop to see – are there any dots that we need to connect, and if so what might they be?” Nolen said.",

Melina Mara/The Washington Post/Getty Images/FILE CNN\n— Officials in California are imploring residents to prepare for a powerful storm set to lash the region with torrential rain later this week as the state continues to recover from colossal amounts of snow that trapped mountain communities. About 16 million people across central and Northern California, including the San Francisco Bay Area and Sacramento, were under flood watches early Wednesday ahead of a storm set to drench the region Thursday with dangerous amounts of rain – in some places on existing layers of heavy snow. “The combination of heavy rain and snowmelt may lead to flooding,” the Weather Prediction Center said. “Creeks and streams in the western foothills of the Sierra Nevada will be most vulnerable to flooding from rain and snowmelt.”",

      "content": " Trump, McCarthy and Fox run out a new truth-defying playbook A Trump industrial complex of politicians hungry for power and conservative media stars chasing profit is spinning a history-defying alternative reality that is putting truth and democracy on the line yet again. A flurry of new developments on Tuesday exposed the nexus between the political fortunes of ex-President Donald Trump, the speakership of Kevin McCarthy and Fox News, showing who really holds power in a Republican Party controlled by its most extreme elements. In a new outburst of falsehoods on Tuesday night, Tucker Carlson – the face of Fox News – cherry picked more excerpts of US Capitol security footage from the January 6, 2021, insurrection, in a fresh bid to blur the truth of that day of infamy in which Trump’s mob, incited by his fury, stormed the building. McCarthy, who gave Carlson exclusive access to the tapes, despite the Fox host’s disproven conspiracy theories about the insurrection, told CNN’s Manu Raju that he had no regrets – even though a group of Republican senators sharply criticized the decision. The California Republican’s comments only exposed his apparent political motivation to appease the extremists he needed to narrowly win the speakership in January and on whom his fragile hold on power depends. A fresh dump of behind-the-scenes emails and texts from the defamation suit brought by Dominion Voting Systems against Fox showed how the network’s top leaders knew claims of voter fraud by Trump and his acolytes were false. But the trove also showed how top talent and executives, including Rupert Murdoch, feared that telling their audience the truth would drive viewers away. This all happened in the wake of Trump’s weekend vow to win back the White House and to launch a new presidency of “retribution” against his enemies. Critics often complain that the media takes the ex-president’s demagoguery too literally. But Trump, the frontrunner for the GOP nomination in 2024, has already proven he is ready to incite violence as a tool of political power. And if he tops the Republican ticket again, he will be one step away from the White House.",

The anticipated release comes a day after the official revealed that a seventh police officer has been fired and others were suspended or left the force after the brutal encounter in the western Tennessee city. Previously, authorities said six officers were fired, five of whom have been criminally charged. The city’s internal investigations into the beatings have finished, so the city intends to release the additional video footage Wednesday afternoon, Memphis Chief Legal Officer Jennifer Sink told a city council committee Tuesday morning. The unreleased footage most notably will include audio of what was said after the beating and after an ambulance took Nichols to a hospital, and it could play an investigative role as his office contemplates additional charges,the county prosecutor previously told CNN. Nichols, a 29-year-old Black man, was repeatedly punched and kicked by Memphis police officers following a traffic stop and brief pursuit on foot on January 7. Nichols was hospitalized after the beating and died three days later. Five police officers, who are also Black, were fired following an internal investigation and were indicted on criminal charges January 26.",

      "content": " In legal filings made public Tuesday as part of Dominion Voting Systems’ $1.6 billion defamation lawsuit against the right-wing channel, a trove of private text messages, emails, and deposition transcripts offered a new look at how the sausage is made behind the scenes at the channel — and it is ugly. The filings expose the face of the network, Tucker Carlson, as a fraud. They show that Rupert Murdoch rejected conspiracy theories about Dominion, despite allowing them to be promoted on his network. And they show the contempt that hosts like Sean Hannity have for some of their colleagues who tried to tell the truth about what actually transpired in the 2020 election. The legal filings total hundreds and hundreds of pages. Journalists will unquestionably be sifting through them for days and weeks to come. But here are some immediate takeaways: ► Carlson “passionately” hates Trump: In a number of private text messages, Carlson was harshly critical of Trump. In one November 2020 exchange, Carlson said Trump’s decision to snub Joe Biden’s inauguration was “so destructive.” Carlson added that Trump’s post-election behavior was “disgusting” and that he was “trying to look away.” In another text message conversation, two days before the January 6 attack, Carlson said, “We are very, very close to being able to ignore Trump most nights. I truly can’t wait.” Carlson added of Trump, “I hate him passionately.” The Fox host said of the Trump presidency, “That’s the last four years. We’re all pretending we’ve got a lot to show for it, because admitting what a disaster it’s been is too tough to digest. But come on. There isn’t really an upside to Trump.” ► Murdoch rejected conspiracies: In his January deposition, Murdoch was repeatedly asked about various electronic voting conspiracy theories — and he rejected all of them. “You’ve never believed that Dominion was involved in an effort to delegitimize and destroy votes for Donald Trump, correct?” a Dominion lawyer asked at one point. “I’m open to persuasion; but, no, I’ve never seen it,” Murdoch replied. ► Top hosts probably ” went too far”: In an email to Fox News chief executive Suzanne Scott, Murdoch conceded that some of his top hosts probably crossed the line in the aftermath of the 2020 election. “Maybe Sean [Hannity] and Laura [Ingraham] went too far,” Murdoch wrote Scott, in an apparent reference to election denialism after Trump’s loss. ► Fury at Fox News’ decision desk: Murdoch lashed out in an email on November 7, 2020, over an imminent decision by Fox News to project that Biden would become the next president. “CNN declares and FOX coming in minutes,” Murdoch wrote to former New York Post editor-in-chief Col Allan. “I hate our Decision Desk people! And pollsters! Some of the same people I think. Just for the hell of it still praying for Az to prove them wrong!,” he said in reference to Biden’s victory over Trump.",

The patient is portrayed by real-life cosmonaut Oleg Novitskiy. Produced by the Yellow, Black and White studio and Channel One Russia – a state-controlled TV station – alongside the country’s space agency, Roscomos, “the movie is aimed to popularize Russia’s space activities, as well as glorify (the) cosmonaut profession,” a statement announcing the project read. Peresild and producer-director Klim Shipenko traveled to the International Space Station (ISS) – 250 miles above earth – alongside veteran Russian cosmonaut Anton Shkaplerov in October 2021 and filmed the movie over the course of 12 days. Peresild was selected to star in the movie after Roscomos posted an open casting call in November 2020. In addition to providing an audition tape, prospective stars had to undergo medical, psychological and physical tests to ensure they could cope with the demands of space travel. Just a few months after shooting on the ISS wrapped, Russia invaded Ukraine and later announced in July 2022 that it was planning to leave the space station – which it operates in partnership with NASA – after 2024. Although “The Challenge” is the first feature-length film to be shot in space, it’s not the first project to be filmed aboard the ISS. Previous films include a 2002 IMAX documentary narrated by Tom Cruise and a 2012 eight-minute science fiction film by entrepreneur and space tourist Richard Garriott. Cruise and director Doug Liman had hoped to nab the prize of first feature film shot in space, revealing in 2020 that they were working on a project in tandem with NASA and Elon Musk’s Space X.",

His father was awarded custody of him when he was young, and he became a child star on the Disney Channel sitcom, “The Suite Life of Zack & Cody” in the early 2000s. The actor also talked about his personal life. He said he lost his virginity at the beach at the age of 14 and became a “serial monogamist” after that. Being a celebrity affected his relationships, he said. “For years that sort of conversation around my recognizability made it sort of hard for me to connect to people,” he said. “I was never sort of a one-night stand guy.” Cooper asked if he had ever been cheated on. “Yeah, by almost every single one of my girlfriends,” Sprouse responded. “Hold on. Emotionally, yes. Very, very much. And my first girlfriend, physically.” He had a high-profile off and on relationship with Reinhart, which, he said, was made more intense because of the “Riverdale” fandom. Sprouse said their 2020 split “was really hard for both of us.”",

While that vow is intended to indicate support of the popular entitlement program, it could actually lead to financial disaster. Tens of millions of senior citizens and other recipients could see their benefits slashed by at least 20% within a decade. The latest Congressional Budget Office projection found that Social Security’s retirement trust fund would be exhausted by 2032. “There’s a sense in which doing nothing does not preserve Social Security but affects the benefits that are not able to be paid out,” CBO Director Phillip Swagel said at a Bipartisan Policy Center event last month. Social Security has long been on shaky financial ground. As the US population ages, there are fewer workers paying into the program and supporting the ballooning number of beneficiaries, who are also living longer. In all, nearly 66 million retired workers, their dependents and survivors, disabled workers and their dependents receive monthly payments. Forecasts on when Social Security’s retirement and disability trust funds may be depleted differ by a few years. Social Security’s trustees last year pegged the date at 2035 if Congress doesn’t act.",

The $180 Ring Battery Doorbell Plus is available to preorder today, with deliveries scheduled to kick off in about a month, on April 5. Arguably the most noticeable improvement Ring made to the new Battery Doorbell Plus is the new 150 x 150 degree field-of-view that provides a 1:1 aspect ratio feed of who or what’s near your front door. That’s a big upgrade from the existing battery doorbell’s 155 x 90 degree field of view. Ring refers to this as a head-to-toe view because it provides an expanded look that now includes your porch or front steps immediately in front of the camera, whereas in the past that may have been an area that was cut off. And because the camera can now see immediately below it, you’ll be able to use Ring’s package alerts (Ring Protect subscription required) to mark the area where deliveries are usually left, allowing the camera to monitor for packages and alert you through the mobile app. Alongside the larger field of view, Ring also bumped up the video resolution from 1080p on the current crop of battery doorbells to 1536p. The increase in resolution should lead to clearer, cleaner video clips both in the live stream view and with recorded clips. The Battery Doorbell Plus will be sold alongside Ring’s Video Doorbell 3 while supplies last, after which the Battery Doorbell Plus will take its spot in Ring’s video doorbell lineup. Ring",

The effort has divided Democrats and highlighted the difficult balance the party is attempting to strike as Republicans accuse them of failing to tackle the issue of crime. A large number of Senate Democrats now plan to support the resolution to rescind the DC crime bill after President Joe Biden announced he would not veto it – a move that surprised and upset members of his party as many believe Congress should not interfere in the political affairs of the district. The resolution of disapproval to block the DC crime bill has already passed the House. If the Senate passes the measure as is expected, it would next go to Biden’s desk. Democrats control a narrow 51-to-49 majority in the Senate, where most legislation requires at least 60 votes to pass to overcome a filibuster. The resolution of disapproval to block the DC crime bill, however, requires only a simple majority vote in the Senate. The DC Council chairman has attempted to withdraw the legislation from congressional review after it became clear the resolution of disapproval was on track to pass the Senate with widespread support. But that attempted withdrawal has not stopped the Senate vote from moving forward. The vote marks the latest effort by Republicans to put vulnerable Senate Democrats on the spot and expose divides within the party over politically charged issues.",

Here’s how we got here – and what comes next Nearly two dozen people are in jail after violent protests at a forest near Atlanta that’s become a national focal point as authorities gear up to begin construction of a massive police and fire training facility. The facility – dubbed “Cop City” by its opponents – has received fierce pushback since its conception by residents who feel there was little public input, conservationists who worry it will carve out a chunk of much-needed forest land and activists who say it will militarize police forces and contribute to further instances of police brutality. Protesters have for months been camping out at the forest, vowing to stop construction, while Atlanta’s mayor is pushing forward with the $90-milion facility. In January, officers killed 26-year-old protester Manuel Esteban Paez Terán during a clearing operation at the site. This week’s arrests are the latest instance of authorities clashing with opponents of the project amid ongoing national – and global – conversations around policing and the protection of the environment. Here’s what to know. Where will the facility be?",

These never-before-seen images inside Putin’s opulent home may also provide a lens into his values and how he views the war, an independent journalist said. Here’s what else you need to know to Get Up to Speed and On with Your Day. 1. Floods As many parts of California attempt to recover from colossal amounts of snow that trapped mountain communities, more than 16 million people are now under flood watches ahead of a storm set to drench the state Thursday with dangerous amounts of rain. The places that will be impacted – mostly across central and Northern California, including the San Francisco Bay Area and Sacramento – have already been dealt layers of snow from the previous brutal storms. In response to the ominous forecast, many residents in the region have been urged to prepare at least two weeks of essentials ahead of the likely flooding. The impending atmospheric river event won’t be the first this year to lash California. Late last year and into the new year, multiple rounds of heavy rains from atmospheric rivers soaked entire neighborhoods and unleashed mudslides that killed at least 18 people. 2. Mexico kidnapping Two of the four Americans who authorities say were kidnapped in Mexico last week have been found dead, officials said Tuesday. The other two were found alive. The group of friends traveled from South Carolina so one of them – a mother of six – could undergo a medical procedure across the border, but they never made it to the appointment. The discovery of the Americans’ whereabouts comes days after the four were targeted by a Mexican cartel that likely mistook them for Haitian drug smugglers, a US official said. Their abduction highlights the ongoing violence that has plagued some Mexican cities during the long-running Mexican drug war as well as the growing business of “medical tourism.”",

      "content": " Adidas has warned that it could suffer its first annual operating loss in more than three decades this year, mostly because it may have to write off the entire range of Yeezy-branded clothing and sneakers. The German sportswear maker said Wednesday that it would face an operating loss of €700 million ($736 million) this year— its first in 31 years — because of a potential €500 million ($527 million) hit related to unsold Yeezy stock, and the cost of a strategic review. Shares in Adidas\n(ADDDF) fell 2.2% Wednesday morning after it published its 2022 results and outlook for 2023. The company broke off its lucrative nine-year partnership with Yeezy designer Ye, the rapper formerly known as Kanye West, in October. Adidas said last month that its annual revenue could plunge by €1.2 billion ($1.27 billion) this year as a direct result of the split, which came after Ye made a series of antisemitic remarks. The rupture knocked around€600 million ($633 million) off the company’s fourth-quarter revenue, Adidas said Wednesday. But the controversy has appeared to fuel demand for Yeezy sneakers through other sellers. Last week, John Mocadlo, chief executive of Impossible Kicks, a large online reseller of high-end sneakers and clothing, said demand for the shoes had surged 30% since around last October.",

In his remarks to the Senate Committee on Banking, Powell said that economically painful interest rate hikes are “likely to be higher than previously anticipated,” and that as a result, the labor market is also “very likely” to weaken. Investors didn’t take the news well, but some analysts think that’s exactly what Powell wanted. What’s happening: Tuesday was a terrible day for markets. The S&P 500 fell 1.5%, the Dow dropped 575 points, or 1.7%, and the tech-heavy Nasdaq composite ended 1.3% lower. After Powell’s testimony, market expectations for a half-percentage point rate hike spiked. At the start of Tuesday, investors were pricing in about a 30% probability for a half-point rate hike later this month. By market close, that probability had grown to 70%, according to the CME FedWatch Tool.

And then after that, make your assumptions,” Zelensky told CNN’s Wolf Blitzer in an interview. But when told of the invitation on Tuesday, McCarthy told CNN that he does not plan to visit Ukraine, and argued that President Joe Biden has not acted quickly enough to aid the country. McCarthy, a California Republican, has said he supports Ukraine but does not support “a blank check,” a position he repeated on Tuesday – even though there is federal oversight of all the dollars that are spent there. “I think that Speaker McCarthy, he never visited Kyiv or Ukraine, and I think it would help him with his position,” Zelensky said. As speaker, McCarthy must navigate competing views within his party over sending additional assistance. There is widespread bipartisan support for Ukraine in Congress, but some House Republicans are calling for an end to further military and financial aid to the country. “Let’s be very clear about what I said: no blank checks, OK? So, from that perspective, I don’t have to go to Ukraine to understand where there’s a blank check or not,” McCarthy told CNN. “I will continue to get my briefings and others, but I don’t have to go to Ukraine or Kyiv to see it. And my point has always been, I won’t provide a blank check for anything.”",

      "content": " The Biden administration is shifting its approach to TikTok The White House’s endorsement of a bill that would give the Biden administration new powers to restrict or ban TikTok in the United States marks a significant shift in the White House’s approach to the Chinese-owned social media app. It’s also a move that the White House has been actively mulling for several weeks while working with lawmakers on Capitol Hill to draft the legislation, Democratic and Republican aides said. A dozen US senators unveiled legislation on Tuesday called the Restricting the Emergence of Security Threats that Risk Information and Communications Technology (RESTRICT) Act. The bill does not target TikTok specifically for a ban. But it aims to give the US government new powers, up to and including a ban, against foreign-linked producers of electronics or software that the Commerce Department deems to be a national security risk. The bill was drafted in close consultation with the White House’s National Security Council as well as the Commerce, Treasury and Justice Departments, according to aides familiar with the process. The National Security Council and Department of Justice proposed specific changes to the text of the legislation, some of which were adopted, according to a Democratic and a Republican aide. The White House’s involvement in the drafting of the bill marked a shift, following more than two years during which the administration’s Committee on Foreign Investments in the United States, or CFIUS, has sought to negotiate a deal with TikTok to address US national security concerns about Chinese ownership of the popular social media app.",

The consensus estimate from economists was for 10.5 million available positions in January, according to Refinitiv. The January JOLTS report showed that hiring increased to 6.37 million from 6.25 million, layoffs surged to 1.72 million from 1.48 million, and quits dropped to 3.89 million from 4.09 million. The continued imbalance between worker supply and demand means the US job market remained tight in January — and that’s not what the Federal Reserve is looking for in its efforts to cool the economy. The Fed remains highly attuned to the monthly JOLTS report as the data can serve as a proxy for labor market demand. Fed officials have expressed concern that a tight labor market could keep upward pressure on wages and, in turn, inflation. Most stock quote data provided by BATS.

The patient is portrayed by real-life cosmonaut Oleg Novitskiy. Produced by the Yellow, Black and White studio and Channel One Russia – a state-controlled TV station – alongside the country’s space agency, Roscomos, “the movie is aimed to popularize Russia’s space activities, as well as glorify (the) cosmonaut profession,” a statement announcing the project read. Peresild and producer-director Klim Shipenko traveled to the International Space Station (ISS) – 250 miles above earth – alongside veteran Russian cosmonaut Anton Shkaplerov in October 2021 and filmed the movie over the course of 12 days. Peresild was selected to star in the movie after Roscomos posted an open casting call in November 2020. In addition to providing an audition tape, prospective stars had to undergo medical, psychological and physical tests to ensure they could cope with the demands of space travel. Just a few months after shooting on the ISS wrapped, Russia invaded Ukraine and later announced in July 2022 that it was planning to leave the space station – which it operates in partnership with NASA – after 2024. Although “The Challenge” is the first feature-length film to be shot in space, it’s not the first project to be filmed aboard the ISS. Previous films include a 2002 IMAX documentary narrated by Tom Cruise and a 2012 eight-minute science fiction film by entrepreneur and space tourist Richard Garriott. Cruise and director Doug Liman had hoped to nab the prize of first feature film shot in space, revealing in 2020 that they were working on a project in tandem with NASA and Elon Musk’s Space X.",

      "content": " “Coal-fired power plants discharge wastewater that can contain toxic metals and other pollutants that contaminate our vital water sources,” EPA Administrator Michael S. Regan told reporters Tuesday. “I’m proud to share the agency is proposing the strongest limits ever on wastewater discharges from coal-fired power plants.” The wastewater proposal follows an announcement in January that the EPA plans to stop six coal-fired power plants from continuing to dump coal ash – a toxic byproduct of coal-fired electricity – into unlined ponds, which can leach into groundwater and nearby waterways. Wednesday’s proposed rule would regulate three types of wastewater generated at coal fired power plants. It also addresses wastewater stored in coal ash ponds. Regan said the EPA estimates the strengthened rule would reduce this toxic pollution by over 580 million pounds per year. The proposed rule would largely not impact coal-fired power plants that already plan to stop burning the fuel by 2032, Assistant Administrator for the EPA’s Office of Water Radhika Fox said – since those plants would be able to comply with the rule “without significant investment.” It is one of several major new or strengthened regulations the Biden administration has rolled out regarding coal power, and it is preparing to release its widely anticipated rule regulating greenhouse gas emissions at coal and natural gas-fired power plants. Regan suggested additional rules would be released soon, and said EPA has worked closely to inform utilities, the power sector and environmental groups when they would be out. Regan said the wastewater rule would be done “in concert with other rules” because he had committed to “try to align our rules so the sector could have some regulatory certainty and understand what longterm investment strategies look like to protect public health and communities.”",

      "content": " House Speaker Kevin McCarthy is seen last month walking to a meeting on Capitol Hill in Washington, DC. Elizabeth Frantz/Reuters CNN\n— House Speaker Kevin McCarthy often spent the last two years avoiding much discussion about the January 6, 2021, attack. Now, he’s effectively put the issue back in the spotlight and on the investigative agenda – a gambit that has divided House and Senate Republicans and reopened ugly wounds inside the GOP. Republicans in the House are beginning to plot multiple probes into the 2021 Capitol attack, including looking into the Democratic-led select committee’s actions from the last Congress, the security failures from that day and potentially even the treatment of January 6 defendants, multiple sources familiar with the work tell CNN. The move comes as McCarthy green-lit the release of January 6 security footage to Fox News host Tucker Carlson, who sought to whitewash the severity of the attack and caused a major uproar among Senate Republicans on Tuesday. “I think they need to watch a little less cable TV,” Sen. John Cornyn of Texas, a member of Senate GOP leadership, said of his Republican counterparts in the House.",

      "content": " The review, looking at whether the Louisville Metro Police Department used excessive force, found that officers use unreasonable tactics including unjustified neck restraints, police dogs and tasers. The report also found that the police department executes search warrants without knocking and announcing. “For years, LMPD has practiced an aggressive style of policing that it deploys selectively, especially against Black people, but also against vulnerable people throughout the city,” the report said. “LMPD cites people for minor offenses, like wide turns and broken taillights, while serious crimes like sexual assault and homicide go unsolved,” the report added. “Some officers demonstrate disrespect for the people they are sworn to protect. Some officers have videotaped themselves throwing drinks at pedestrians from their cars; insulted people with disabilities; and called Black people ‘monkeys,’ ‘animal,’ and ‘boy.’” The DOJ found that “police officers’ forcible and violent entry into a person’s home strikes at the heart of the constitutional protection against unreasonable government intrusion.” “But Louisville Metro’s and LMPD’s unlawful conduct did not start in 2020. As an LMPD leader told us shortly after we opened this investigation, ‘Breonna Taylor was a symptom of problems that we have had for years,’” the report said. The department’s leaders failed to curb the “unacceptable” conduct, the report found. “Failures of leadership and accountability have allowed unlawful conduct to continue unchecked,” DOJ said. “Even when city and police leaders announced solutions, they failed to follow through. In LMPD, officer misconduct too often goes unnoticed and unaddressed. At times, LMPD leaders have endorsed and defended unlawful conduct.”",

While Beijing has stepped up its public criticism of the US, Haines told the Senate Intelligence Committee that the intelligence community assesses that China still believes it “benefits most by preventing a spiraling of tensions and by preserving stability in its relationship with the United States.” The US intelligence community believes that Russia “probably does not want a direct military conflict with US and NATO forces, but there is potential for that to occur,” according to the unclassified annual threat assessment report of the intelligence community issued on Wednesday that US intelligence leaders testified about. Haines said in her testimony that the Ukraine conflict has become a “grinding attritional war in which neither side has a definitive military advantage,” but said that Russian President Vladimir Putin was likely to carry on, possibly for years. “We do not foresee the Russian military recovering enough this year to make major territorial gains, but Putin most likely calculates the time works in his favor, and that prolonging the war, including with potential pauses in the fighting, may be his best remaining pathway to eventually securing Russia’s strategic interests in Ukraine, even if it takes years,” Haines said. Haines ticked through the global challenges the US faces – from Russia and China to Iran and North Korea – along with risks related to cyber and technology and authoritarian governments.",
