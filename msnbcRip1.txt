      "content": " Stewartlasered in on the hypocrisy of “our loudest tough-on-crime advocates … trying to solve the problem with the problem.” And, on social media, millions of people reveled in his complete dismantling of Republican Oklahoma state Sen. Nathan Dahm’s illogical arguments about guns. Dahm is a Second Amendment poster boy: He has proposed a number of bills in the Oklahoma Senate to further relax gun restrictions and even authored the first anti-red-flag law in the country — red flag laws, remember, are intended to keep guns out of the hands of people deemed to be threats to themselves or others. Sitting across from the former “Daily Show” host, Dahm rehashed the same tired arguments, including the rage-inducing claim that gun-related deaths are attributable to “fatherlessness” and “broken homes.” (This is classic misogynistic and racist language used against women who take care of themselves and their families.) Dahm, like many conservatives, also leaned on the language of “protection.” They deploy it in pro-gun arguments, as well as in many other instances when they want to stoke public fear and rage — from their nonsense claims about wanting to “protect girls sports” by banning trans kids from participating on girls school teams to “protecting children” by banning books that recognize the existence of LGBTQ and Black people and their histories. Stewart made it a point to nail Dahm on the hypocrisy of drag show bans — which, in Dahm’s logic, are necessary to “protect children” — by emphasizing that the leading cause of child deaths isn’t drag queens. It’s guns. Stewart made it a point to nail Dahm on the hypocrisy of drag show bans. “What you’re telling me is you don’t mind infringing free speech to protect children from this amorphous thing that you think of,” Stewart said, “but when it comes to children that have died, you don’t give a flying f--- to stop that because that shall not be infringed.” \"That's your opinion,\" Dahm replied, before claiming his argument wasn't wildly hypocritical because \"the First Amendment is treated differently than the Second Amendment.\" It’s easy for people like Dahm to speak on behalf of children, because children have very little agency and power — that’s the point. (Even though an overwhelming number of school-age children who are interviewed and polled express fear and anxiety about school shootings.) Children are red herrings. The real people Dahm is protecting are the people in power, his fellow legislators and, more broadly, the white supremacist patriarchal status quo.",

As an athlete-turned-preacher-turned-writer, I’m no doomsday prophet. I’m an eternal optimist who believes in particular that Black boys from South Carolina can do beautiful things. At the same time, I wish those prophesying that the 23-year-old Morant is going to lose everything, or those calling him ignorant, would try to understand what life was like for Black boys growing up in South Carolina. For some of us, leaving home is not as simple as packing our bags. There is the survivor’s guilt, the fear that leaving our family and friends behind counts as a lack of love for home. “There ain’t nothing for you here,” people back home tell us. But we want there to be something there for us, and we feel guilty when we make it and our people don’t. Then we are condemned by a white world that refuses to extend us the grace that it extends to others. We see white boys from South Carolina displaying enough firepower to destroy themselves, their families, plus us and our families, and being praised for it. I need Morant to understand what making it out of the “Corridor of Shame” actually means. But I need Morant to understand what making it out of the “Corridor of Shame” actually means: not just for those who look to us for inspiration, but actually to us. For the Black athlete, especially the Black boy athlete from South Carolina, we carry within us the possibility of loving ourselves and the places we come from in ways that people from outside our hometowns have refused. We carry knowledge of our communities that others don’t have. We carry the hopes of other young Black boys from South Carolina, and that’s something that we have to be OK with. As heavy as that obligation may feel at times, we should treat it like a gift, treat it like something sacred. That’s not corny or immature. That’s actually loving the places that shaped us.",

      "content": " GOP leaders find themselves in a budget bind of their own making The Washington Post published a good profile over the weekend on a congressional staffer most Americans have probably never heard of. His name is Dan Meyer, he’s House Speaker Kevin McCarthy’s chief of staff, and as the Post put it, “no other person — save McCarthy — is expected to play a more pivotal role this year in trying to steer House Republicans through a series of potentially explosive conflicts.” Of particular interest in the piece was Meyer’s concerns about rank-and-file House Republican members making demands on spending “that will prove difficult, if not impossible, for McCarthy to reconcile.” From the article: The party’s demands for spending cuts have also become increasingly outlandish. On a recent private phone call with a longtime colleague after McCarthy was elected speaker, Meyer marveled at the seeming absurdity of his position. As Meyer told his friend, McCarthy is in a nearly impossible bind, having vowed to advance a budget proposal that eradicates the deficit in a decade without touching Medicare and Social Security or increasing taxes. None of this should surprise anyone. McCarthy is not a congressional rookie, and he must’ve understood that he was making promises that he couldn’t possibly keep: Balancing the federal budget in a decade without raising taxes on anyone, and without touching social insurance programs like Social Security and Medicare, would require GOP lawmakers to propose brutally ridiculous cuts to practically every other part of the federal budget. As Rep. Brendan Boyle of Pennsylvania, the top Democrat on the House Budget Committee, told The New York Times, “If you say that you’re going to eliminate the deficit by the end of the decade, but you say you’re not going to touch Social Security, you’re not going to touch Medicare, you’re not going to touch defense — that means you have to cut 100 percent of everything that’s left. So I welcome this debate. Math is on our side.” McCarthy knew this. He nevertheless adopted a “we’ll figure it out later” posture with his own members.",

But now’s not the time to rest on our laurels. We have the opportunity and indeed the responsibility to swing for the fences, so that we can ensure Florida remains No. 1. Don’t worry about the chattering class. Ignore all the background noise. Keep the compass set to true north. We will stand strong. We will hold the line. We won’t back down. And I can promise you this, you ain’t seen nothing yet.” If you’re a teacher, you can’t talk about gender identity with students from the third grade to the eighth grade. You are not allowed to use any pronoun except the one you were assigned at birth. Do you want to major or minor in gender studies in college? Well, not if Republicans get their way. They’re considering legislation that would put a stop to that and any discussion of intersectionality at the college level, and also would end any diversity, equity and inclusion programs. There’s a separate bill that would force anyone who writes about public figures and gets paid for it to register with the government, basically forcing people to get government permission to form an opinion. On abortion, the Republican legislature doesn’t think the 15-week ban goes far enough — they now want control of women’s bodies at six weeks, before most women even know they’re pregnant. The state also wants to make it a felony for a parent to drive their undocumented child to school; you could be punished with up to five years in prison for doing so. Or to so-called harbor an undocumented person which depending on how the law is interpreted, could literally just mean living with them. The legislature is eager to clear DeSantis’ path to the presidential nomination by silencing any opposing views or risking any unhelpful stories about him or them. And they’re also covering all the right-wing primary culture war bases by allowing people to carry guns in Florida permit-free, which should be great news for school shooters while ignoring actual crises like the exploding crises of housing affordability and insurers leaving the state.",
