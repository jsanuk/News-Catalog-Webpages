 Gas bubbles from the Nord Stream 2 leak reach the surface of the Baltic Sea near Bornholm, Denmark on September 27, 2022. Danish Defence Command/Reuters/FILE CNN\nâ€” Ukraine has denied any involvement in the sabotage of the Nord Stream pipelines following a media report citing new intelligence that a â€œpro-Ukrainian groupâ€? may have been behind last yearâ€™s attack targeting Russiaâ€™s gas deliveries to Europe. The dismissal by a senior Ukrainian official on Tuesday came in response to a report by the New York Times, which cited new intelligence that had been reviewed by United States officials. â€œAlthough I enjoy collecting amusing conspiracy theories about (the Ukrainian) government, I have to say: (Ukraine) has nothing to do with the Baltic Sea mishap and has no information about â€˜pro-(Ukraine) sabotage groups,â€™â€? Mykhailo Podolyak, top adviser to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, wrote on Twitter. The New York Times said the new intelligence reviewed by US officials suggested a group loyal to Ukraine but acting independently of the government in Kyiv were involved in the operation.

 The number of young children in the US who have died from opioid overdoses has increased significantly, according to a new study on accidental poisonings of children 5 and younger. The study, published Wednesday in the journal Pediatrics, looked at a nationwide database and found 731 children 5 and under among poison-related fatalitiesbetween 2005 and 2018. Some of the children were poisoned by over-the-counter pain, cold and allergy medicines, but the highest number of fatal poisonings by far were from opioids. The trend got worse over time. In 2005, opioids accounted for 24.1% (seven of 29) of the substances contributing to child deaths, compared with 52.2% (24 of 46) in 2018. â€œIt truly is striking to see, looking at this data, how different the proportions were between 2005 and 2018,â€? said study co-author Dr. Christopher Gaw, an associate fellow at Childrenâ€™s Hospital of Philadelphia whose research primarily focuses on pediatric injury and poisoning. Gaw thinks that peopleâ€™s preferences for particular drugs have shifted and that that has had an impact on fatality numbers. In the late 1990s and early 2000s, prescription-based opioids were the drug of choice. As guidelines became stricter and more doctors and dentists became aware of the opioid epidemic, they prescribed fewer opioids, so people turned to things like heroin and fentanyl. Illicitly used drugs like fentanyl, which is 100 times stronger than morphine and can kill quickly, donâ€™t come in childproof packaging.

 US to relax Covid testing restrictions for travelers from China as soon as Friday The US is planning to relax Covid-19 testing restrictions for travelers from China as soon as Friday, a source familiar told CNN Tuesday, citing a decline in Covid cases, hospitalizations, and deaths and more data surrounding the variants that were circulating in China. In December, federal health officials announced that, starting January 5, the US would require all travelers from China to show a negative Covid test result before flying to the country after Beijingâ€™s rapid easing of Covid restrictions led to a surge in cases. The source said the order was put in place in an effort to protect US citizens following â€œa large wave of infections in the PRC,â€? coupled with â€œa lack of transparencyâ€? by Chinese officials surrounding the surge. The Biden administration still plans to monitor cases in China and around the world, keeping in place a Traveler-based Genomic Surveillance (TGS) program that surveys travelers on details around new variants.

 â€œIâ€™m going to be Suzy Eddie Izzard, thatâ€™s how Iâ€™m going to roll,â€? she said. â€œSo, people can choose what they want. They canâ€™t make a mistake. They canâ€™t go wrong with me.â€? The Emmy-winner said on the podcast that sheâ€™s wanted to go by the name of Suzy since she was 10 years old. At the time, she said, she thought â€œno this is not going to happen.â€? Once Izzardâ€™s Hollywood career began picking up, she said she felt like she couldnâ€™t â€œredoâ€? what her public-facing name had already become. â€œAnd then I thought well, if Iâ€™m doing she/her, why donâ€™t I add that to the name? Because Iâ€™ve got â€˜Edwardâ€™ on my passport, itâ€™s quite wooden and big and I donâ€™t call myself that. So, I just thought Iâ€™ll add Suzy there, and then Eddie, and people can choose what they want and no one can go wrong,â€? she said. Izzard came out as transgender in the 1980s. She started using the pronouns she/her in 2019 after the chancellor for Swansea University referred to Izzard with those pronouns during a ceremony in which she was presented with an honorary degree. She explained that â€œit felt amazingâ€? to hear herself referred to as â€œshe/herâ€? and adopted the pronouns as her own thereafter. Izzard has had a decades-long career in film and television appearing in the â€œOceanâ€™s 11â€? films and NBCâ€™s â€œHannibalâ€? series, among many other titles, in addition to her stand-up comedy work. Outside of Hollywood, Izzard is a member of the UKâ€™s Labour Party and is a dedicated political activist.

 Threat of rising seas to Asian megacities could be way worse than we thought, study warns The study predicts Asian megacities such as Manila, the capital of the Philippines, are particularly at risk from rising sea levels. Dante Diosina Jr/Anadolu Agency/Getty Images Hong KongCNN\nâ€” Parts of Asiaâ€™s largest cities could be under water by 2100 thanks to rising sea levels, according to a new study that combines both the impact of climate change with natural oceanic fluctuations. Sea levels have already been on the rise due to increasing ocean temperatures and unprecedented levels of ice melting caused by climate change. But a report published in the journal Nature Climate Change offers fresh insight and stark warnings about how bad the impact could be for millions of people.

 Why El Salvadorâ€™s president Nayib Bukele wants everyone to know about his new prison Analysis by Stefano Pozzebon, CNN Published\n5:58 PM EST, Tue March 7, 2023 Link Copied! Above: Detainees being moved to a \"mega prison.\" By mid-2022, up to 2% of El Salvador's population 18 and older, or roughly 100,000 people, was in prison, according to an Amnesty international assessment based on local media reports. Office of the President of El Salvador/Getty Images CNN\nâ€”
Last week, El Salvador's president Nayib Bukele posted a typically divisive video on Twitter. To the sound of thrilling fast-paced music, it showed hundreds of detainees being transferred to a new \"megaprison\" officially named the Center for Confining Terrorism. Constructed last year to host the Central American country's burgeoning prison population, it is the largest prison in the Americas, with capacity for 40,000 inmates.

 Tranq has become a bigger part of Phillyâ€™s street fentanyl supply. The wounds left behind are killing people Programming note: Anderson Cooper hosts a town hall examining the deadly toll fentanyl has taken across the US. Watch â€˜America Addicted: The Fentanyl Crisisâ€™ on CNN tonight at 9 p.m. ET. PhiladelphiaCNN\nâ€” What drug users and people who work with them in Philadelphia talk about is the smell. The smell of rotting flesh from open infected wounds. Some users say they feel ashamed of the state of their bodies, but more feel a sense of urgency. They need help. The wounds are killing them. â€œIt is absolutely horrible. Thatâ€™s the reality, though,â€? said James Sherman, known as Sherm around Philadelphiaâ€™s Kensington neighborhood, where he once used drugs and where he now tries to help those still on the streets. The need for help has become more urgent over the last three years, as the animal tranquilizer xylazine, also called tranq, has become a bigger part of Phillyâ€™s street fentanyl supply. Xylazine can cause large wounds that wonâ€™t heal, no matter where you inject it and they can appear even if you snort it or smoke it. Infections are common and can even lead to amputations.
\"I could have lost my hand\" - users tell CNN how the arrival of xylazine in their drug supply has changed their lives, and their bodies.

 Elon Musk on Tuesday offered an optimistic picture for how Twitter can improve the advertising business he helped derail and boost its bottom line while also admitting that keeping the social network running is proving to be a challenge after multiple rounds of layoffs. In remarks at a Morgan Stanley Conference, Musk laid out his vision to boost Twitterâ€™s core advertising business by adopting the standard strategy of most of the companyâ€™s peers: improving the relevance of the ads it serves. â€œThe advertising relevance is the most gigantic thing,â€? Musk said. â€œAnd this is going to sound totally bizarre, but Twitter did not consider relevance in advertising until three months ago.â€? With that change, and larger cost cuts across the organization, Musk said he believes Twitter has â€œgot a shot at being cash flow positive next quarter.â€? â€œGoing forward, Twitter will have very relevant, useful advertising,â€? Musk said. â€œAnd because it is useful, because it is relevant, there will be a massive increase in revenue, because it is now useful. So Iâ€™m very optimistic about the future. Itâ€™s been a very difficult four months, but Iâ€™m optimistic about the future.â€? Since taking over the platform in late October, Twitter has suffered a mass exodus of top brands as Musk relaxed some content moderation policies, restored incendiary accounts and made a number of erratic remarks concerning politics and world affairs. Musk, who has previously tweeted about his hatred for advertising, made a quick bet on bolstering a paid subscription offering instead, but it has reportedly struggled to gain traction. He also took the time to thank advertisers that have stuck with Twitter throughout his rocky takeover, including Disney and Apple.

 Huge amounts of that plastic waste end up in the oceans. The majority comes from land, swept into rivers â€“ by rain, wind, overflowing storm drains and littering â€“ and transported out to sea. A smaller but still significant amount, such as fishing gear, is lost or simply dumped into the ocean. Once plastic gets into the ocean, it doesnâ€™t decompose but instead tends to break down into tiny pieces. These particles â€œare really not easily cleaned up, weâ€™re stuck with them,â€? Erdle said. Marine life can get entangled in plastic or mistake it for food. Plastic can also leach toxic chemicals into the water. And it isnâ€™t just an environmental disaster; plastic is also a huge climate problem. Fossil fuels are the raw ingredient for most plastics, and they produce planet-heating pollution throughout their lifecycle â€“ from production to disposal. Plastic pollution on a beach in Honduras. The Ocean Cleanup Figuring out exactly how much plastic is in the ocean is a hard exercise. â€œThe ocean is a complex place. There are lots of ocean currents, there are changes over time due to weather and due to conditions on the ground,â€? Erdle said.
The world's oceans are polluted by a \"plastic smog\" made up of an estimated 171 trillion plastic particles that if gathered would weigh around 2.3 million tons, according to a new study.

 The Chinese government could use TikTok to control data on millions of people and harness the short-form video app to shape public opinion should China invade Taiwan, FBI Director Christopher Wray told the Senate Intelligence Committee Wednesday. Wray responded affirmatively to questions from Republican Sen. Marco Rubio of Florida, the panelâ€™s ranking member, on whether TikTok would allow Beijing widespread control over data and a valuable influence tool in the event of war in the Taiwan Strait. â€œThe most fundamental piece that cuts across every one of those risks and threats that you mentioned that I think Americans need to understand is that something thatâ€™s very sacred in our country â€”the difference between the private sector and public sector â€” thatâ€™s a line that is nonexistent in the way that the CCP [Chinese Communist Party] operates,â€? Wray told Rubio in the hearing. Rubio, the top Republican on the Senate panel, argued that TikTok presents â€œa substantial national security threat for the country of a kind that we didnâ€™t face in the past.â€? Wrayâ€™s comments come a day after Gen. Paul Nakasone, head of the US National Security Agency, told the Senate Armed Services Committee that he worried TikTok could censor videos to shape public opinion in a way that threatens US national security interests. Itâ€™s the latest in a full-court press from US officials to sound the alarm about TikTokâ€™s alleged security risks as Congress weighs giving the Biden administration more authority to address the alleged threat posed by the platform, up to and including banning the app in the United States TikTok CEO Shou Chew said this week that the Chinese government has â€œnever asked us for US user dataâ€? and the company would not provide it if the government did ask. Chew also said that â€œmisinformation and propaganda has no place on our platform, and our users do not expect that.â€?

 What is 8K resolution, and is an 8K TV worth it? By Rebecca Day, CNN Underscored Updated\n9:28 AM EST, Wed March 8, 2023 Link Copied! iStock If youâ€™ve spent any time looking for a new TV, youâ€™ve probably already heard of 8K â€” which claims to offer the highest resolution picture you can get. Coming straight on the heels of recent upgrades to picture quality, 8K Ultra HD TV is indeed a ground-breaking new format, offering a whopping four times the resolution of 4K. The problem is, not only are these new 8K TVs considerably more expensive than their 4K brethren, there is also virtually no 8K content available to view on them yet. Mike Fidler, executive director of the 8K Association, says current 8K models are ideal for any AV enthusiast interested in â€œthe ultimate entertainment experience.â€? But, as we saw when HDTV first came out in the late 1990â€™s, hardware typically hits the market well before the content. In fact, even though 4K Ultra HD TVs have been selling for about a decade, 4K content is still catching up.
Wondering what 8K TV is all about? Here is everything you need to know about the new 8K Ultra HD TV format, whether you're  buying a new TV or just want to stay in the know.

 Ringâ€™s got a new battery-powered video doorbell camera that promises some major upgrades, including an improved field-of-view and the highest resolution video available in any wireless Ring doorbell. The $180 Ring Battery Doorbell Plus is available to preorder today, with deliveries scheduled to kick off in about a month, on April 5. Arguably the most noticeable improvement Ring made to the new Battery Doorbell Plus is the new 150 x 150 degree field-of-view that provides a 1:1 aspect ratio feed of who or whatâ€™s near your front door. Thatâ€™s a big upgrade from the existing battery doorbellâ€™s 155 x 90 degree field of view. Ring refers to this as a head-to-toe view because it provides an expanded look that now includes your porch or front steps immediately in front of the camera, whereas in the past that may have been an area that was cut off. And because the camera can now see immediately below it, youâ€™ll be able to use Ringâ€™s package alerts (Ring Protect subscription required) to mark the area where deliveries are usually left, allowing the camera to monitor for packages and alert you through the mobile app. Alongside the larger field of view, Ring also bumped up the video resolution from 1080p on the current crop of battery doorbells to 1536p. The increase in resolution should lead to clearer, cleaner video clips both in the live stream view and with recorded clips. The Battery Doorbell Plus will be sold alongside Ringâ€™s Video Doorbell 3 while supplies last, after which the Battery Doorbell Plus will take its spot in Ringâ€™s video doorbell lineup. Ring

 If youâ€™re planning an outdoor adventure in the middle of winter, itâ€™s important to come fully prepared. That means picking out the best layers for the most warmth, like fleece-lined leggings and sweaters, and choosing a reliable down jacket to fend off chilly temperatures. It also means finding the best gloves or mittens to keep your hands warm to prevent unexpected injuries like frostbite or frostnip. With average daily highs in the low 30s, Minnesotans have figured out what gear works best to keep you warm â€” and the team behind Frost River, a locally owned outdoor gear company based in Duluth, are no strangers to staying warm in winter weather. One of my favorite pieces of winter gear by the brand is the Frost River Northern Pacific mittens. Theyâ€™re made with a buckskin deer hide leather outer and polar fleece inner liner; Iâ€™ve had them for four years and theyâ€™ve kept my hands extremely warm in all sorts of situations. Frost Riverâ€™s Northern Pacific mittens are perfect for everyone, whether youâ€™re a cold weather sports enthusiast or simply need a pair to wear around town in the winter. Handmade by a small business based in Duluth, Minnesota, these gloves are insulated with a thick polar fleece inner lining and covered in genuine buckskin leather. These durable and comfortable mittens will keep your hands warm all winter long â€” even in subzero temperatures. What we liked about them Frost Riverâ€™s Northern Pacific mittens come in three colors: buckskin (brown), palomino (golden yellow) and black. Theyâ€™re lined with soft polar fleece and have a premium buckskin leather outer thatâ€™s soft and flexible yet durable. Whether Iâ€™m hiking in the backcountry or wearing them while running an errand in the city, the Northern Pacifics have been my go-to winter mittens for years now since they keep me so warm during all types of cold weather activities. Super warm, even in extreme temperatures Erica Zazo

 Phones, chargers and cords, oh my! These days, travel isnâ€™t as simple as a carry-on bag and a checked piece of luggage. Todayâ€™s travelers are bogged down with cords, chargers, smartphones and more tech that inadvertently gets lost, tangled, misplaced or â€” worst of all â€” broken in transit. Rather than just stuffing cumbersome laptop and phone chargers, adapters and cables into a purse, backpack or laptop bag, keep it all organized with a travel cord organizer designed specifically for tech accessories. Before you buy, consider how much gear you actually travel with. If itâ€™s just you, a laptop and a phone, you can skip the ones with all the bells and whistles and multiple compartments, and instead opt for a simple zip enclosure kit. But if you travel with kids or your partner is constantly misplacing their tech, having lots of roomy pouches and pockets that accommodate multiple accessories ensures thereâ€™s space for everyoneâ€™s must-haves. Ultimately, having a dedicated spot for your tech accessories makes the travel experience more stress-free â€” and whoâ€™s opposed to that? Make travel easier and tech more accessible with any one of our 21 favorite travel cable and tech organizers. Padded for protection and just 1.5 inches thick, the Calpak Tech Organizer has multiple pockets for cords, chargers, phones and headphones, with mesh panels that make it easy to see whatâ€™s stored inside. Plus, elastic pockets and loops make it easy to access certain items. All of your tech accessories can fit inside this zipper-enclosed pouch, which also has a carrying handle and exterior mesh pocket. Choose from eight shades and patterns that coordinate with Calpakâ€™s packing cubes and luggage. It should come as no surprise that the travel pros at Away have come up with a solution for tech equipment. The Away Tech Case is split into two compartments: A larger, zippered mesh one for laptop chargers and bulkier items and a smaller one for cords, earbuds and other smaller accessories. Elastic loops keep everything secure, so you donâ€™t have to worry about anything spilling out. Away's Tech Case is available in three colors to match your favorite piece of Away luggage. And, for an extra $20, you can personalize it with three embroidered letters, making it a great gift item for the frequent traveler in your life. With a translucent shell that makes it easy to see everything stored inside, this Tech Kit will keep you from blindly searching through your bags ever again. A crush-proof outer shell with full zipper closure provides protection so you donâ€™t have to worry if your luggage gets tossed around during transit. Inside, thereâ€™s an interior separator with elastic cable organizers and a pocket with enough room for hard drives, power banks, wireless headphones and SD cards. For a quirky take on personalization, you can upload a photo of your pet and the company will print it on the kit for you to take your furry friend along on your next vacation. The folks at Monos know a thing or two about creating a travel essential â€” and this Folio Kit is no exception. Available in seven chic colorways, not only does this folio have room for credit cards and a key ring, but it's also got dedicated spots for your tech essentials. Inside, you'll find several elastic loops for charging cords and pens as well as a zippered pocket for smaller items. There are also dedicated pouches that can fit SD cards, travel documents and even space for an e-reader or tablet.
Rather than just stuffing chargers, adapters and cords into a bag, keep it all organized with a dedicated travel tech case. Here are 21 of our favorites.

 IMF chief: Ukraine war will have â€˜devastatingâ€™ consequences for Russiaâ€™s economy The International Monetary Fund has drawn criticism for forecasting that Russia will see stronger economic growth this year than either the United Kingdom or Germany, despite rising pressure from Western sanctions. â€œWhen you take our projections over a medium term, what they mean is Russia[â€™s economy] shrinking by at least 7%,â€? Georgieva said in an interview that aired Wednesday. In January, the IMF projected that Russiaâ€™s economy would expand by 0.3% this year and 2.1% the next. That was much more optimistic than the latest forecasts from both the World Bank and the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development. Economists at those groups have penciled in contractions of 3.3% and 5.6% in 2023, respectively. Even Russiaâ€™s own central bank, which extended emergency capital controls for another six months on Monday, has said gross domestic product might contract by 1% this year. Jeffrey Sonnenfeld, a Yale management professor, wrote in Fortune magazine Monday that the â€œIMF has been asleep at the switchâ€? and parroting propaganda from Russian President Vladimir Putin. â€œWith respect to Russia, it is naively echoing Putinâ€™s own invented GDP forecasts, in effect, canonizing and legitimating these economic myths with no verification,â€? said Sonnenfeld and two colleagues, Stephen Roach and Steven Tian.

 In January, some pharmacy chains announced plans to distribute mifepristone to patients with prescriptions, following a US Food and Drug Administration policy change permitting the direct sale of the abortion drug by certified pharmacies. Mary Zeigler Bill Lax/Bill Lax/FSU Photography Service Just a few months later, one of the countryâ€™s biggest pharmacy retailers, Walgreens, abruptly announced that it wouldnâ€™t distribute mifepristone in 21 Republican-controlled states. On Tuesday, Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom said in a tweet that the state of California â€œwonâ€™t be doing businessâ€? with the chain, â€œor any company that cowers to the extremists and puts womenâ€™s lives at risk.â€? Walgreens told NPR in a statement on Friday that itâ€™s working to sell the drug in â€œjurisdictions where it is legal and operationally feasible.â€? One reason Walgreensâ€™ move is so stunning is because the states where the company has decided not to make the drug available include several which have legalized abortion or protected it under their state constitutionâ€”including Florida, Kansas and Montana. In Florida, Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis has pledged to sign a ban on abortion at six weeks, but nothing has crossed his desk yet and abortion remains legal in the state until 15 weeks. In Kansas and Montana, voters last year rejected ballot initiatives eroding abortion rights. None of that seemed to make any difference to Walgreens. Nor did it matter that no lawsuit has been filed challenging the sale of the abortion medication. The warning of potential legal action was enough to make the company backtrack.
Walgreens' decision not to distribute mifepristone to patients with prescriptions in 21 GOP-led states is legally baffling, writes UC Davis law professor Mary Ziegler.

 On February 2, Curiosity observed rays of sunlight stretching across the horizon and illuminating a bank of clouds as the sun set on Mars. Itâ€™s the first time the rays, known as crepuscular rays, have been seen so clearly on the red planet. The rover is conducting a survey of twilight clouds on Mars to follow up on its previous observations of night-shining clouds. In 2021, Curiosity used its black and white navigation cameras to watch the structure of those clouds as they moved on Mars. Clouds provide deeper insight about weather patterns and conditions. Scientists can use information about when and where clouds form on Mars to learn more about the planetâ€™s atmospheric composition and temperatures, as well as wind. The new survey, which kicked off in January and will wrap up later this month, utilizes the roverâ€™s color camera located on its mast to watch as cloud particles grow. On Mars, most clouds are made of frozen ice and float about 37 miles (60 kilometers) above the ground. But Curiosity spotted clouds that reach a higher altitude, as seen in the new photo, leading researchers to believe they are made of frozen carbon dioxide ice â€” or dry ice. Scientists are still studying them to figure out why this happens. The Curiosity rover captured this feather-shaped iridescent cloud just after sunset on January 27. NASA/JPL-Caltech/MSSS

 FAA administrator unclear whether airliner close calls are on the rise After at least six incidents this year, the nationâ€™s top aviation official says he does not know whether close calls involving airliners are on the rise, but says the issue and its causes will be examined at a safety conference next week. â€œItâ€™s a good question,â€? Billy Nolen, acting head of the Federal Aviation Administration, said after testifying to the Senate Commerce Committee â€“ his second time there in a month. Nolen defended his agencyâ€™s handling of the safety incidents, some of which were averted when pilots â€“ not the air traffic controllers from his agency â€“ avoided a collision. He said officials are â€œtreating each of these as if it had been an actual event.â€? â€œThe FAA absolutely has a grasp on the situation and itâ€™s something that we look at every day,â€? Nolen told reporters. â€œWeâ€™ll take a look at these near misses and see if there are lessons to be learned.â€? He said a major safety meeting next week will include industry officials and ask the â€œhard questions.â€? â€œLetâ€™s just stop to see â€“ are there any dots that we need to connect, and if so what might they be?â€?

 Two Americans have returned to the US from Mexico and are being treated at a hospital after an armed kidnapping left two of their friends dead and spurred a days-long search for the US travelers who had crossed the border for a medical procedure, officials say. The four Americans were found in a â€œwooden houseâ€? in or near the Mexican border city of Matamoros, where they were kidnapped on Friday, Tamaulipas Governor AmÃ©rico Villarreal announced Tuesday. In the days they were missing, he said, the group had been taken to several places â€œto create confusion and avoid rescue efforts.â€? Victims Shaeed Woodard and Zindell Brown were found dead at the scene, a US official familiar with the ongoing investigation told CNN. Their remains are expected to be repatriated to the US after a Mexican medical examiner completes a forensic examination to determine their causes of death, the source added. The surviving travelers, Latavia Washington McGee and and Eric Williams, were found alive, and Washington McGee had not been injured, Villarreal said. Williams, however, had been shot three times â€“ once in one leg and twice in the other â€“ and was brought to a hospital in Texas to undergo surgery, his wife, Michele Williams, told CNN. The FBI confirmed Tuesday that Williams and Washington McGee had been transported to a hospital in the US. Williams was emotional as he spoke to his wife on the phone, Michele Williams told CNN, explaining that her husband considered Woodard and Brown to be like his â€œbrothers.â€? Their 11-year-old son was also happy to hear from his father, she said.

 US Ambassador to Japan Rahm Emanuel speaks to CNN at the ambassador's residence in Tokyo on Wednesday. CNN TokyoCNN\nâ€” China should not be surprised Washington and its allies in Asia are deepening military ties given Beijingâ€™s aggressive behavior toward many of its neighbors, the US ambassador to Japan said Wednesday in an exclusive interview with CNN. â€œYou look at India, you look at the Philippines, you look at Australia, you look at the United States, Canada or Japan. They (China) have had in just the last three months a military or some type of confrontation with every country. And then theyâ€™re shocked that countries are taking their own steps for deterrence to protect themselves. What did they think they were going to do?â€? Ambassador Rahm Emanuel said in the interview at his residence in Tokyo. Beijing has denied being an aggressor in all those instances and accused Washington of being the primary instigator of heightened tensions in the region. On Tuesday, Chinaâ€™snew Foreign Minister Qin Gang warned that â€œconflict and confrontationâ€? with the US is inevitable if Washington does not change course.

 Some California residents are urged to prepare 2 weeks of essentials ahead of expected flooding this week Clouds hover above a rare accumulation of snow in the mountains of the Los Padres National Forest in Big Sur, California, on February 23, 2023. The area is expected to see heavy rain later this week. Melina Mara/The Washington Post/Getty Images/FILE CNN\nâ€” Officials in California are imploring residents to prepare for a powerful storm set to lash the region with torrential rain later this week as the state continues to recover from colossal amounts of snow that trapped mountain communities. About 16 million people across central and Northern California, including the San Francisco Bay Area and Sacramento, were under flood watches early Wednesday ahead of a storm set to drench the region Thursday with dangerous amounts of rain â€“ in some places on existing layers of heavy snow. â€œThe combination of heavy rain and snowmelt may lead to flooding,â€? the Weather Prediction Center said. â€œCreeks and streams in the western foothills of the Sierra Nevada will be most vulnerable to flooding from rain and snowmelt.â€?

 An elegant portrait of a pole dancer in Oman celebrates a woman's strength in nature Published 8th March 2023 Credit: Eman Ali An elegant portrait of a pole dancer in Oman celebrates a woman's strength in nature Written by Jacqui Palumbo, CNN In Snap, we look at the power of a single photograph, chronicling stories about how both modern and historical images have been made. In her sunlit portrait of the pole dancing instructor Nusaiba Al Maskari, the UK-born Omani photographer Eman Ali creates an arresting visual simile between the strength of Al Maskari's body and the Hajar Mountains in the background. Gracefully extending herself horizontally from her pole, she aligns with the peaks above Muscat, a single fluid line across the picture plane.
Eman Ali's arresting image of Nusaiba Al Maskari is set against the mountainous backdrop of Muscat, where pole dancing is rarely practiced.

 Trump, McCarthy and Fox run out a new truth-defying playbook A Trump industrial complex of politicians hungry for power and conservative media stars chasing profit is spinning a history-defying alternative reality that is putting truth and democracy on the line yet again. A flurry of new developments on Tuesday exposed the nexus between the political fortunes of ex-President Donald Trump, the speakership of Kevin McCarthy and Fox News, showing who really holds power in a Republican Party controlled by its most extreme elements. In a new outburst of falsehoods on Tuesday night, Tucker Carlson â€“ the face of Fox News â€“ cherry picked more excerpts of US Capitol security footage from the January 6, 2021, insurrection, in a fresh bid to blur the truth of that day of infamy in which Trumpâ€™s mob, incited by his fury, stormed the building. McCarthy, who gave Carlson exclusive access to the tapes, despite the Fox hostâ€™s disproven conspiracy theories about the insurrection, told CNNâ€™s Manu Raju that he had no regrets â€“ even though a group of Republican senators sharply criticized the decision. The California Republicanâ€™s comments only exposed his apparent political motivation to appease the extremists he needed to narrowly win the speakership in January and on whom his fragile hold on power depends. A fresh dump of behind-the-scenes emails and texts from the defamation suit brought by Dominion Voting Systems against Fox showed how the networkâ€™s top leaders knew claims of voter fraud by Trump and his acolytes were false. But the trove also showed how top talent and executives, including Rupert Murdoch, feared that telling their audience the truth would drive viewers away. This all happened in the wake of Trumpâ€™s weekend vow to win back the White House and to launch a new presidency of â€œretributionâ€? against his enemies. Critics often complain that the media takes the ex-presidentâ€™s demagoguery too literally. But Trump, the frontrunner for the GOP nomination in 2024, has already proven he is ready to incite violence as a tool of political power. And if he tops the Republican ticket again, he will be one step away from the White House.

 Memphis officials to release more video from Tyre Nicholsâ€™ deadly beating today, after saying a 7th officer was fired Officials in Memphis are expected Wednesday to release about 20 more hours of video relating to Januaryâ€™s deadly police beating of Tyre Nichols â€“ as well as some records of the cityâ€™s now-finished internal probe into 13 police officers and four fire department personnel, a Memphis official said. The anticipated release comes a day after the official revealed that a seventh police officer has been fired and others were suspended or left the force after the brutal encounter in the western Tennessee city. Previously, authorities said six officers were fired, five of whom have been criminally charged. The cityâ€™s internal investigations into the beatings have finished, so the city intends to release the additional video footage Wednesday afternoon, Memphis Chief Legal Officer Jennifer Sink told a city council committee Tuesday morning. The unreleased footage most notably will include audio of what was said after the beating and after an ambulance took Nichols to a hospital, and it could play an investigative role as his office contemplates additional charges,the county prosecutor previously told CNN. Nichols, a 29-year-old Black man, was repeatedly punched and kicked by Memphis police officers following a traffic stop and brief pursuit on foot on January 7. Nichols was hospitalized after the beating and died three days later. Five police officers, who are also Black, were fired following an internal investigation and were indicted on criminal charges January 26.

 In legal filings made public Tuesday as part of Dominion Voting Systemsâ€™ $1.6 billion defamation lawsuit against the right-wing channel, a trove of private text messages, emails, and deposition transcripts offered a new look at how the sausage is made behind the scenes at the channel â€” and it is ugly. The filings expose the face of the network, Tucker Carlson, as a fraud. They show that Rupert Murdoch rejected conspiracy theories about Dominion, despite allowing them to be promoted on his network. And they show the contempt that hosts like Sean Hannity have for some of their colleagues who tried to tell the truth about what actually transpired in the 2020 election. The legal filings total hundreds and hundreds of pages. Journalists will unquestionably be sifting through them for days and weeks to come. But here are some immediate takeaways: â–º Carlson â€œpassionatelyâ€? hates Trump: In a number of private text messages, Carlson was harshly critical of Trump. In one November 2020 exchange, Carlson said Trumpâ€™s decision to snub Joe Bidenâ€™s inauguration was â€œso destructive.â€? Carlson added that Trumpâ€™s post-election behavior was â€œdisgustingâ€? and that he was â€œtrying to look away.â€? In another text message conversation, two days before the January 6 attack, Carlson said, â€œWe are very, very close to being able to ignore Trump most nights. I truly canâ€™t wait.â€? Carlson added of Trump, â€œI hate him passionately.â€? The Fox host said of the Trump presidency, â€œThatâ€™s the last four years. Weâ€™re all pretending weâ€™ve got a lot to show for it, because admitting what a disaster itâ€™s been is too tough to digest. But come on. There isnâ€™t really an upside to Trump.â€? â–º Murdoch rejected conspiracies: In his January deposition, Murdoch was repeatedly asked about various electronic voting conspiracy theories â€” and he rejected all of them. â€œYouâ€™ve never believed that Dominion was involved in an effort to delegitimize and destroy votes for Donald Trump, correct?â€? a Dominion lawyer asked at one point. â€œIâ€™m open to persuasion; but, no, Iâ€™ve never seen it,â€? Murdoch replied. â–º Top hosts probably â€? went too farâ€?: In an email to Fox News chief executive Suzanne Scott, Murdoch conceded that some of his top hosts probably crossed the line in the aftermath of the 2020 election. â€œMaybe Sean [Hannity] and Laura [Ingraham] went too far,â€? Murdoch wrote Scott, in an apparent reference to election denialism after Trumpâ€™s loss. â–º Fury at Fox Newsâ€™ decision desk: Murdoch lashed out in an email on November 7, 2020, over an imminent decision by Fox News to project that Biden would become the next president. â€œCNN declares and FOX coming in minutes,â€? Murdoch wrote to former New York Post editor-in-chief Col Allan. â€œI hate our Decision Desk people! And pollsters! Some of the same people I think. Just for the hell of it still praying for Az to prove them wrong!,â€? he said in reference to Bidenâ€™s victory over Trump.
Fox News continues to be exposed like never before.

 The trailer outlines the movieâ€™s plot: A surgeon, Zhenya, played by Russian actress Yulia Peresild, has to perform heart surgery on a sick cosmonaut in space because he is unable to return to Earth for treatment. The patient is portrayed by real-life cosmonaut Oleg Novitskiy. Produced by the Yellow, Black and White studio and Channel One Russia â€“ a state-controlled TV station â€“ alongside the countryâ€™s space agency, Roscomos, â€œthe movie is aimed to popularize Russiaâ€™s space activities, as well as glorify (the) cosmonaut profession,â€? a statement announcing the project read. Peresild and producer-director Klim Shipenko traveled to the International Space Station (ISS) â€“ 250 miles above earth â€“ alongside veteran Russian cosmonaut Anton Shkaplerov in October 2021 and filmed the movie over the course of 12 days. Peresild was selected to star in the movie after Roscomos posted an open casting call in November 2020. In addition to providing an audition tape, prospective stars had to undergo medical, psychological and physical tests to ensure they could cope with the demands of space travel. Just a few months after shooting on the ISS wrapped, Russia invaded Ukraine and later announced in July 2022 that it was planning to leave the space station â€“ which it operates in partnership with NASA â€“ after 2024. Although â€œThe Challengeâ€? is the first feature-length film to be shot in space, itâ€™s not the first project to be filmed aboard the ISS. Previous films include a 2002 IMAX documentary narrated by Tom Cruise and a 2012 eight-minute science fiction film by entrepreneur and space tourist Richard Garriott. Cruise and director Doug Liman had hoped to nab the prize of first feature film shot in space, revealing in 2020 that they were working on a project in tandem with NASA and Elon Muskâ€™s Space X.
The space race has expanded to new frontiers in recent years, moving into business, tourism ... and now cinema.

 Not touching Social Security could lead to 20% benefit cut within a decade President Joe Biden and House Republicans have promised not to touch Social Security in their battle over cutting spending to address the nationâ€™s debt ceiling crisis. While that vow is intended to indicate support of the popular entitlement program, it could actually lead to financial disaster. Tens of millions of senior citizens and other recipients could see their benefits slashed by at least 20% within a decade. The latest Congressional Budget Office projection found that Social Securityâ€™s retirement trust fund would be exhausted by 2032. â€œThereâ€™s a sense in which doing nothing does not preserve Social Security but affects the benefits that are not able to be paid out,â€? CBO Director Phillip Swagel said at a Bipartisan Policy Center event last month. Social Security has long been on shaky financial ground. As the US population ages, there are fewer workers paying into the program and supporting the ballooning number of beneficiaries, who are also living longer. In all, nearly 66 million retired workers, their dependents and survivors, disabled workers and their dependents receive monthly payments. Forecasts on when Social Securityâ€™s retirement and disability trust funds may be depleted differ by a few years. Social Securityâ€™s trustees last year pegged the date at 2035 if Congress doesnâ€™t act.

 Ringâ€™s got a new battery-powered video doorbell camera that promises some major upgrades, including an improved field-of-view and the highest resolution video available in any wireless Ring doorbell. The $180 Ring Battery Doorbell Plus is available to preorder today, with deliveries scheduled to kick off in about a month, on April 5. Arguably the most noticeable improvement Ring made to the new Battery Doorbell Plus is the new 150 x 150 degree field-of-view that provides a 1:1 aspect ratio feed of who or whatâ€™s near your front door. Thatâ€™s a big upgrade from the existing battery doorbellâ€™s 155 x 90 degree field of view. Ring refers to this as a head-to-toe view because it provides an expanded look that now includes your porch or front steps immediately in front of the camera, whereas in the past that may have been an area that was cut off. And because the camera can now see immediately below it, youâ€™ll be able to use Ringâ€™s package alerts (Ring Protect subscription required) to mark the area where deliveries are usually left, allowing the camera to monitor for packages and alert you through the mobile app. Alongside the larger field of view, Ring also bumped up the video resolution from 1080p on the current crop of battery doorbells to 1536p. The increase in resolution should lead to clearer, cleaner video clips both in the live stream view and with recorded clips. The Battery Doorbell Plus will be sold alongside Ringâ€™s Video Doorbell 3 while supplies last, after which the Battery Doorbell Plus will take its spot in Ringâ€™s video doorbell lineup. Ring

[\"Clare Foran,Ted Barrett,Ali Zaslav\"]
 Senate expected to vote to block controversial DC crime bill The Senate is expected to vote on Wednesday to pass a Republican-led resolution to block a controversial Washington, DC, crime bill that opponents have criticized as weak on crime. The effort has divided Democrats and highlighted the difficult balance the party is attempting to strike as Republicans accuse them of failing to tackle the issue of crime. A large number of Senate Democrats now plan to support the resolution to rescind the DC crime bill after President Joe Biden announced he would not veto it â€“ a move that surprised and upset members of his party as many believe Congress should not interfere in the political affairs of the district. The resolution of disapproval to block the DC crime bill has already passed the House. If the Senate passes the measure as is expected, it would next go to Bidenâ€™s desk. Democrats control a narrow 51-to-49 majority in the Senate, where most legislation requires at least 60 votes to pass to overcome a filibuster. The resolution of disapproval to block the DC crime bill, however, requires only a simple majority vote in the Senate. The DC Council chairman has attempted to withdraw the legislation from congressional review after it became clear the resolution of disapproval was on track to pass the Senate with widespread support. But that attempted withdrawal has not stopped the Senate vote from moving forward. The vote marks the latest effort by Republicans to put vulnerable Senate Democrats on the spot and expose divides within the party over politically charged issues.

 Clashes over Atlantaâ€™s â€˜Cop Cityâ€™ led to a protesterâ€™s killing and dozens of arrests. Hereâ€™s how we got here â€“ and what comes next Nearly two dozen people are in jail after violent protests at a forest near Atlanta thatâ€™s become a national focal point as authorities gear up to begin construction of a massive police and fire training facility. The facility â€“ dubbed â€œCop Cityâ€? by its opponents â€“ has received fierce pushback since its conception by residents who feel there was little public input, conservationists who worry it will carve out a chunk of much-needed forest land and activists who say it will militarize police forces and contribute to further instances of police brutality. Protesters have for months been camping out at the forest, vowing to stop construction, while Atlantaâ€™s mayor is pushing forward with the $90-milion facility. In January, officers killed 26-year-old protester Manuel Esteban Paez TerÃ¡n during a clearing operation at the site. This weekâ€™s arrests are the latest instance of authorities clashing with opponents of the project amid ongoing national â€“ and global â€“ conversations around policing and the protection of the environment.

Hereâ€™s how we got here â€“ and what comes next Nearly two dozen people are in jail after violent protests at a forest near Atlanta thatâ€™s become a national focal point as authorities gear up to begin construction of a massive police and fire training facility. The facility â€“ dubbed â€œCop Cityâ€? by its opponents â€“ has received fierce pushback since its conception by residents who feel there was little public input, conservationists who worry it will carve out a chunk of much-needed forest land and activists who say it will militarize police forces and contribute to further instances of police brutality. Protesters have for months been camping out at the forest, vowing to stop construction, while Atlantaâ€™s mayor is pushing forward with the $90-milion facility. In January, officers killed 26-year-old protester Manuel Esteban Paez TerÃ¡n during a clearing operation at the site. This weekâ€™s arrests are the latest instance of authorities clashing with opponents of the project amid ongoing national â€“ and global â€“ conversations around policing and the protection of the environment.

 Russia's war in Ukraine What we're covering The head of the Wagner mercenary group claims that the eastern part of the besieged Ukrainian city of Bakhmut is now under his fighters' control. A spokesperson for the Ukrainian military did not specifically address the Wagner claims, but said its troops have held off Russian forces despite facing dozens of combat assaults on Tuesday. President Volodymyr Zelensky has defended his decision to keep Ukrainian forces in Bakhmut, warning that withdrawing would risk Russian capture of other cities. Kyiv has denied any involvement in the sabotage of the Nord Stream gas pipelines after a media report cited new intelligence that a \"pro-Ukrainian group\" may have been behind the attack last year. A source familiar with the US intelligence told CNN the assessment was not made with high confidence. Gas emanating from a leak on the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline in the Baltic Sea on September 27.

 Get '5 Things' in your inbox A new report has shed light on Russian President Vladimir Putinâ€™s secret, lavish lifestyle and reputed girlfriend as his invasion of Ukraine rages on. These never-before-seen images inside Putinâ€™s opulent home may also provide a lens into his values and how he views the war, an independent journalist said. Hereâ€™s what else you need to know to Get Up to Speed and On with Your Day. 1. Floods As many parts of California attempt to recover from colossal amounts of snow that trapped mountain communities, more than 16 million people are now under flood watches ahead of a storm set to drench the state Thursday with dangerous amounts of rain. The places that will be impacted â€“ mostly across central and Northern California, including the San Francisco Bay Area and Sacramento â€“ have already been dealt layers of snow from the previous brutal storms. In response to the ominous forecast, many residents in the region have been urged to prepare at least two weeks of essentials ahead of the likely flooding. The impending atmospheric river event wonâ€™t be the first this year to lash California. Late last year and into the new year, multiple rounds of heavy rains from atmospheric rivers soaked entire neighborhoods and unleashed mudslides that killed at least 18 people. 2. Mexico kidnapping Two of the four Americans who authorities say were kidnapped in Mexico last week have been found dead, officials said Tuesday. The other two were found alive. The group of friends traveled from South Carolina so one of them â€“ a mother of six â€“ could undergo a medical procedure across the border, but they never made it to the appointment. The discovery of the Americansâ€™ whereabouts comes days after the four were targeted by a Mexican cartel that likely mistook them for Haitian drug smugglers, a US official said. Their abduction highlights the ongoing violence that has plagued some Mexican cities during the long-running Mexican drug war as well as the growing business of â€œmedical tourism.â€?

 Adidas has warned that it could suffer its first annual operating loss in more than three decades this year, mostly because it may have to write off the entire range of Yeezy-branded clothing and sneakers. The German sportswear maker said Wednesday that it would face an operating loss of â‚¬700 million ($736 million) this yearâ€” its first in 31 years â€” because of a potential â‚¬500 million ($527 million) hit related to unsold Yeezy stock, and the cost of a strategic review. Shares in Adidas\n(ADDDF) fell 2.2% Wednesday morning after it published its 2022 results and outlook for 2023. The company broke off its lucrative nine-year partnership with Yeezy designer Ye, the rapper formerly known as Kanye West, in October. Adidas said last month that its annual revenue could plunge by â‚¬1.2 billion ($1.27 billion) this year as a direct result of the split, which came after Ye made a series of antisemitic remarks. The rupture knocked aroundâ‚¬600 million ($633 million) off the companyâ€™s fourth-quarter revenue, Adidas said Wednesday. But the controversy has appeared to fuel demand for Yeezy sneakers through other sellers. Last week, John Mocadlo, chief executive of Impossible Kicks, a large online reseller of high-end sneakers and clothing, said demand for the shoes had surged 30% since around last October.

In his remarks to the Senate Committee on Banking, Powell said that economically painful interest rate hikes are â€œlikely to be higher than previously anticipated,â€? and that as a result, the labor market is also â€œvery likelyâ€? to weaken. Investors didnâ€™t take the news well, but some analysts think thatâ€™s exactly what Powell wanted. Whatâ€™s happening: Tuesday was a terrible day for markets. The S&P 500 fell 1.5%, the Dow dropped 575 points, or 1.7%, and the tech-heavy Nasdaq composite ended 1.3% lower. After Powellâ€™s testimony, market expectations for a half-percentage point rate hike spiked. At the start of Tuesday, investors were pricing in about a 30% probability for a half-point rate hike later this month. By market close, that probability had grown to 70%, according to the CME FedWatch Tool.

 Zelensky invites House Speaker Kevin McCarthy to visit Ukraine Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky is inviting House Speaker Kevin McCarthy to visit Ukraine to see the situation on the ground first hand â€“ an invitation that comes as the Republican Party faces a divide over whether the United States should continue to provide aid to the country under attack from Russia. â€œMr. McCarthy, he has to come here to see how we work, whatâ€™s happening here, what war caused us, which people are fighting now, who are fighting now. And then after that, make your assumptions,â€? Zelensky told CNNâ€™s Wolf Blitzer in an interview. But when told of the invitation on Tuesday, McCarthy told CNN that he does not plan to visit Ukraine, and argued that President Joe Biden has not acted quickly enough to aid the country. McCarthy, a California Republican, has said he supports Ukraine but does not support â€œa blank check,â€? a position he repeated on Tuesday â€“ even though there is federal oversight of all the dollars that are spent there. â€œI think that Speaker McCarthy, he never visited Kyiv or Ukraine, and I think it would help him with his position,â€? Zelensky said. As speaker, McCarthy must navigate competing views within his party over sending additional assistance. There is widespread bipartisan support for Ukraine in Congress, but some House Republicans are calling for an end to further military and financial aid to the country. â€œLetâ€™s be very clear about what I said: no blank checks, OK? So, from that perspective, I donâ€™t have to go to Ukraine to understand where thereâ€™s a blank check or not,â€? McCarthy told CNN. â€œI will continue to get my briefings and others, but I donâ€™t have to go to Ukraine or Kyiv to see it. And my point has always been, I wonâ€™t provide a blank check for anything.â€?

 The Biden administration is shifting its approach to TikTok The White Houseâ€™s endorsement of a bill that would give the Biden administration new powers to restrict or ban TikTok in the United States marks a significant shift in the White Houseâ€™s approach to the Chinese-owned social media app. Itâ€™s also a move that the White House has been actively mulling for several weeks while working with lawmakers on Capitol Hill to draft the legislation, Democratic and Republican aides said. A dozen US senators unveiled legislation on Tuesday called the Restricting the Emergence of Security Threats that Risk Information and Communications Technology (RESTRICT) Act. The bill does not target TikTok specifically for a ban. But it aims to give the US government new powers, up to and including a ban, against foreign-linked producers of electronics or software that the Commerce Department deems to be a national security risk. The bill was drafted in close consultation with the White Houseâ€™s National Security Council as well as the Commerce, Treasury and Justice Departments, according to aides familiar with the process. The National Security Council and Department of Justice proposed specific changes to the text of the legislation, some of which were adopted, according to a Democratic and a Republican aide. The White Houseâ€™s involvement in the drafting of the bill marked a shift, following more than two years during which the administrationâ€™s Committee on Foreign Investments in the United States, or CFIUS, has sought to negotiate a deal with TikTok to address US national security concerns about Chinese ownership of the popular social media app.

 The number of available jobs in the US shrank in January The number of job openings in the United States fell to 10.8 million in January,down from an upwardly revised 11.23 million in December, the Bureau of Labor Statistics reported Wednesday as part of its monthly Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey, or JOLTS. The consensus estimate from economists was for 10.5 million available positions in January, according to Refinitiv. The January JOLTS report showed that hiring increased to 6.37 million from 6.25 million, layoffs surged to 1.72 million from 1.48 million, and quits dropped to 3.89 million from 4.09 million. The continued imbalance between worker supply and demand means the US job market remained tight in January â€” and thatâ€™s not what the Federal Reserve is looking for in its efforts to cool the economy.

 The trailer outlines the movieâ€™s plot: A surgeon, Zhenya, played by Russian actress Yulia Peresild, has to perform heart surgery on a sick cosmonaut in space because he is unable to return to Earth for treatment. The patient is portrayed by real-life cosmonaut Oleg Novitskiy. Produced by the Yellow, Black and White studio and Channel One Russia â€“ a state-controlled TV station â€“ alongside the countryâ€™s space agency, Roscomos, â€œthe movie is aimed to popularize Russiaâ€™s space activities, as well as glorify (the) cosmonaut profession,â€? a statement announcing the project read. Peresild and producer-director Klim Shipenko traveled to the International Space Station (ISS) â€“ 250 miles above earth â€“ alongside veteran Russian cosmonaut Anton Shkaplerov in October 2021 and filmed the movie over the course of 12 days. Peresild was selected to star in the movie after Roscomos posted an open casting call in November 2020. In addition to providing an audition tape, prospective stars had to undergo medical, psychological and physical tests to ensure they could cope with the demands of space travel. Just a few months after shooting on the ISS wrapped, Russia invaded Ukraine and later announced in July 2022 that it was planning to leave the space station â€“ which it operates in partnership with NASA â€“ after 2024. Although â€œThe Challengeâ€? is the first feature-length film to be shot in space, itâ€™s not the first project to be filmed aboard the ISS. Previous films include a 2002 IMAX documentary narrated by Tom Cruise and a 2012 eight-minute science fiction film by entrepreneur and space tourist Richard Garriott. Cruise and director Doug Liman had hoped to nab the prize of first feature film shot in space, revealing in 2020 that they were working on a project in tandem with NASA and Elon Muskâ€™s Space X.

 Russia's war in Ukraine What we're covering The head of the Wagner mercenary group claims that the eastern part of the besieged Ukrainian city of Bakhmut is now under his fighters' control. Meanwhile, a spokesperson for the Ukrainian military said its troops have held off Russian forces despite facing dozens of combat assaults on Tuesday. President Volodymyr Zelensky has defended his decision to keep Ukrainian forces in Bakhmut, warning that withdrawing would risk Russian capture of other cities. Kyiv denied any involvement in the sabotage of the Nord Stream gas pipelines after a media report cited new intelligence that a \"pro-Ukrainian group\" may have been behind the attack last year.

 â€œI firmly believe in standing up for what is right, ensuring equality and expanding opportunities for all,â€? Savage said in an Instagram post Monday. â€œIâ€™m running for Congress because itâ€™s time to restore faith in government by offering reasonable, innovative and compassionate solutions to our countryâ€™s most pressing issues.â€? The move comes after Schiff announced his plans to run for outgoing Sen. Dianne Feinsteinâ€™s seat in January in what is likely to be a competitive Democratic primary. Feinstein will not run for reelection in 2024. Savage, who famously played the lead role in â€œBoy Meets Worldâ€? starring as Cory Matthews, filed paperwork with the Federal Elections Commission to run for Californiaâ€™s 30th District seat back in January. The district includes West Hollywood, Pasadena and Burbank, and has one of the most diverse constituencies in the country. This is not Savageâ€™s first foray into politics. He previously ran unsuccessfully for a seat on the West Hollywood City Council in 2022. He is also not the only candidate vying for Schiffâ€™s soon to be vacant seat. Democratic state Sen. Anthony Portantino, Democratic state Assembly member Laura Friedman, who previously served as the Mayor of Glendale, and West Hollywood mayor Sepi Shyne have all filed paperwork to run.

 â€œCoal-fired power plants discharge wastewater that can contain toxic metals and other pollutants that contaminate our vital water sources,â€? EPA Administrator Michael S. Regan told reporters Tuesday. â€œIâ€™m proud to share the agency is proposing the strongest limits ever on wastewater discharges from coal-fired power plants.â€? The wastewater proposal follows an announcement in January that the EPA plans to stop six coal-fired power plants from continuing to dump coal ash â€“ a toxic byproduct of coal-fired electricity â€“ into unlined ponds, which can leach into groundwater and nearby waterways. Wednesdayâ€™s proposed rule would regulate three types of wastewater generated at coal fired power plants. It also addresses wastewater stored in coal ash ponds. Regan said the EPA estimates the strengthened rule would reduce this toxic pollution by over 580 million pounds per year. The proposed rule would largely not impact coal-fired power plants that already plan to stop burning the fuel by 2032, Assistant Administrator for the EPAâ€™s Office of Water Radhika Fox said â€“ since those plants would be able to comply with the rule â€œwithout significant investment.â€? It is one of several major new or strengthened regulations the Biden administration has rolled out regarding coal power, and it is preparing to release its widely anticipated rule regulating greenhouse gas emissions at coal and natural gas-fired power plants. Regan suggested additional rules would be released soon, and said EPA has worked closely to inform utilities, the power sector and environmental groups when they would be out. Regan said the wastewater rule would be done â€œin concert with other rulesâ€? because he had committed to â€œtry to align our rules so the sector could have some regulatory certainty and understand what longterm investment strategies look like to protect public health and communities.â€?
The Environmental Protection Agency on Wednesday proposed a new rule for regulating wastewater from coal-fired power plants that are stronger than previous rules in the Obama and Trump administrations.

 House Speaker Kevin McCarthy is seen last month walking to a meeting on Capitol Hill in Washington, DC. Elizabeth Frantz/Reuters CNN\nâ€” House Speaker Kevin McCarthy often spent the last two years avoiding much discussion about the January 6, 2021, attack. Now, heâ€™s effectively put the issue back in the spotlight and on the investigative agenda â€“ a gambit that has divided House and Senate Republicans and reopened ugly wounds inside the GOP. Republicans in the House are beginning to plot multiple probes into the 2021 Capitol attack, including looking into the Democratic-led select committeeâ€™s actions from the last Congress, the security failures from that day and potentially even the treatment of January 6 defendants, multiple sources familiar with the work tell CNN. The move comes as McCarthy green-lit the release of January 6 security footage to Fox News host Tucker Carlson, who sought to whitewash the severity of the attack and caused a major uproar among Senate Republicans on Tuesday. â€œI think they need to watch a little less cable TV,â€? Sen. John Cornyn of Texas, a member of Senate GOP leadership, said of his Republican counterparts in the House.

 The review, looking at whether the Louisville Metro Police Department used excessive force, found that officers use unreasonable tactics including unjustified neck restraints, police dogs and tasers. The report also found that the police department executes search warrants without knocking and announcing. â€œFor years, LMPD has practiced an aggressive style of policing that it deploys selectively, especially against Black people, but also against vulnerable people throughout the city,â€? the report said. â€œLMPD cites people for minor offenses, like wide turns and broken taillights, while serious crimes like sexual assault and homicide go unsolved,â€? the report added. â€œSome officers demonstrate disrespect for the people they are sworn to protect. Some officers have videotaped themselves throwing drinks at pedestrians from their cars; insulted people with disabilities; and called Black people â€˜monkeys,â€™ â€˜animal,â€™ and â€˜boy.â€™â€? The DOJ found that â€œpolice officersâ€™ forcible and violent entry into a personâ€™s home strikes at the heart of the constitutional protection against unreasonable government intrusion.â€? â€œBut Louisville Metroâ€™s and LMPDâ€™s unlawful conduct did not start in 2020. As an LMPD leader told us shortly after we opened this investigation, â€˜Breonna Taylor was a symptom of problems that we have had for years,â€™â€? the report said. The departmentâ€™s leaders failed to curb the â€œunacceptableâ€? conduct, the report found. â€œFailures of leadership and accountability have allowed unlawful conduct to continue unchecked,â€? DOJ said. â€œEven when city and police leaders announced solutions, they failed to follow through. In LMPD, officer misconduct too often goes unnoticed and unaddressed. At times, LMPD leaders have endorsed and defended unlawful conduct.â€?
The Justice Department issued a scathing critique Wednesday on the Louisville Metro Police Department after a nearly two-year review it launched into the force following the botched raid that killed Breonna Taylor.

 US intel chiefs say China likely to press Taiwan and seek to undercut US US Director of National Intelligence Avril Haines told Congress Wednesday that Chinese President Xi Jinping is likely to press Taiwan and try to undercut US influence in the coming years as he begins a third term as president. While Beijing has stepped up its public criticism of the US, Haines told the Senate Intelligence Committee that the intelligence community assesses that China still believes it â€œbenefits most by preventing a spiraling of tensions and by preserving stability in its relationship with the United States.â€? The US intelligence community believes that Russia â€œprobably does not want a direct military conflict with US and NATO forces, but there is potential for that to occur,â€? according to the unclassified annual threat assessment report of the intelligence community issued on Wednesday that US intelligence leaders testified about. Haines said in her testimony that the Ukraine conflict has become a â€œgrinding attritional war in which neither side has a definitive military advantage,â€? but said that Russian President Vladimir Putin was likely to carry on, possibly for years. â€œWe do not foresee the Russian military recovering enough this year to make major territorial gains, but Putin most likely calculates the time works in his favor, and that prolonging the war, including with potential pauses in the fighting, may be his best remaining pathway to eventually securing Russiaâ€™s strategic interests in Ukraine, even if it takes years,â€?

Haines ticked through the global challenges the US faces â€“ from Russia and China to Iran and North Korea â€“ along with risks related to cyber and technology and authoritarian governments.

That number will probably grow higher as we get closer to the 2024 Presidential Election. MSNBC National Security Analyst Frank Figliuzzi breaks down these numbers with American Voices host Alicia Menendez.

Tennessee has now enacted the nationâ€™s first law banning public drag shows. And itâ€™s not just a Tennessee problem. Lawmakers in more than a dozen states have proposed similar measures restricting drag performance. Former HUD Secretary JuliÃ¡n Castro spoke with drag performer, trans activist and Tennessee native Eureka Oâ€™Hara about just how dangerous this new law is for drag performers and the LGBTQ community as a whole.

President Joe Biden formally unveiled his new budget proposal this week, and it aims to cut the federal deficit by nearly 3 trillion dollars over the next decade. Itâ€™s a tall order, but the White House says it can be accomplished through a combination of raising taxes on billionaires and oil companies, doing away with the carried-interest loophole, and curtailing pandemic-related spending. Meanwhile, the Republicans are still struggling to devise a counter proposal. Congressman Sean Casten joined former HUD Secretary JuliÃ¡n Castro to talk about about the schisms in the GOP caucus.

As former President Donald Trump faces multiple legal jeopardies, Congressman Adam Schiff of California joins Ali Velshi with a major question on his mind: If Manhattan is moving forward with investigating Donald Trump, why didnâ€™t the Justice Department? â€œThey said Michael Cohen had to go to jail for his role in that so what's the argument that the guy who directed and coordinated the scheme gets a pass?â€? Schiff also notes that as the path to 2024 widens, Donald Trumpâ€™s threat of â€œretributionâ€? is merely a ploy. â€œThis is Donald Trump doing what he does best sadly, tragically, and that is played the victim and appeal to people's sense of victimhood.â€?

There have been more than 300 anti-trans bills introduced to statehouses across the country so far this year. New anti-trans bills are being introduced every single week. One new bill in Florida would allow the state to take custody of children whose parents support them in receiving gender-affirming care. â€œThere is no offset for this,â€? says Imara Jones of Translash Media. â€œIf in one place, a child is separated from their parents, there is no repair for that.â€?
