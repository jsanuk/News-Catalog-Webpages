Houston – Police across the country are looking for ways to crack down on illegal drag racing. Street races usually happen randomly between drivers on streets or interstates, but police say they can result in others joining in and blocking off intersections while racing, drifting, and doing donuts or other stunts. They can also put traffic on hold for hours, and the drivers can be dangerous to approach. Now, some states say they’re cracking down on this. Texas and California have formed street racing and takeover task forces that focus on seizing these vehicles. Florida now allows law enforcement to arrest and prosecute street racers for related videos posted online. New York, and Washington have also announced plans for noise identifying cameras and harsher punishment for street racers. \"The participants will violently confront other drivers who they feel are trying to interrupt their activities. Stay in your car, roll up the windows and lock the door, call 9-1-1 and let us know what’s going on\" Martin said. Police say they want to encourage racers to have fun, legally. And hope the actions of illegal racers don't tarnish activities for legal car club members.",

Marsha Blackburn called key impeachment witness Vindman an 'opportunist,' while he fired back at her accusations Elbridge Colby: There's a huge conflict brewing with China, and it’s not tenable that we can do that and Ukraine. Retired Lt. Col. Alexander Vindman, who made waves as a witness during the first impeachment proceedings of former President Donald Trump, is now being accused of trying to profit off the war in Ukraine by pitching lucrative defense contracts through his private company. In a statement to Fox News Digital, Sen. Marsha Blackburn, R-Tenn., who was one of the sharpest critics of Vindman throughout the impeachment investigation, blasted him as an \"opportunist,\" and accused him of undertaking continuous efforts to try and personally profit from his attacks against the Trump administration to his reported dealings in Ukraine. The first impeachment of Trump centered around a July 2019 call in which Trump pressed Ukrainian President Zelenskyy to launch investigations into the Biden family’s actions and business dealings in Ukraine—specifically Hunter Biden’s ventures with Ukrainian natural gas firm Burisma Holdings. The president’s request came after millions in U.S. military aid to Ukraine had been frozen, which Democrats and some witnesses, including Vindman, cited as a quid pro quo arrangement. \"When conservatives speak the truth, the mainstream media panics and desperately attempts to provide cover for the left. They did this for Alexander Vindman, just like they did for Hunter Biden, Dr. Fauci and teachers unions,\" Blackburn said, referencing liberal media outlets' staunch defense of Vindman throughout his time as a witness during the impeachment investigation. Then-National Security Council aide Lt. Col. Alexander Vindman was sworn in to testify before the House Intelligence Committee on Capitol Hill in Washington during a public impeachment hearing of President Donald Trump's efforts to tie U.S. aid for Ukraine to investigations of his political opponents.(AP Photo/Andrew Harnik)",

People who have had COVID-19 may experience lingering chest pains for up to a year after infection, a new study found. \"Long COVID,\" which refers to conditions that linger for months or even years after infection, impacts nearly one in five people who have had the virus, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has reported. Researchers at Intermountain Health, a nonprofit health care system based in Salt Lake City, Utah, examined over 140,000 adult patients for cardiovascular symptoms. Those who previously had COVID experienced greater degrees of chest pain six months to a year after initially getting the virus, compared to those who tested negative in the same time frame. The study findings were presented on March 5 at the American College of Cardiology's 2023 Scientific Conference, held in New Orleans, Louisiana.",

Shifting focus from family-friendly entertainment to politics and ideological wars, Disney had a rough 2022 as its two biggest \"woke\" flicks flopped at the box office. From legal battles with Fla. Gov. Ron DeSantis to leadership changes, one author argues the company has been left in \"turmoil\" as a result of putting politics over the company's mission. \"I believe [Bob Chapek] was ousted because the business is in turmoil,\" author and executive Jennifer Sey said on Fox Nation's \"The Death of Hollywood.\" \"Their stock is down 40% on the year, and he's more concerned with fighting with a very popular governor than actually improving the product and improving the business.\" During the first episode of Fox Nation's \"The Death of Hollywood\" hosted by FOX Radio's Jimmy Failla, industry experts explore how the battle between Disney and Gov. DeSantis began as early as the controversial Parental Rights in Education Act. The act, dubbed the \"Don't Say Gay Bill\" by opponents, caused outrage among many Disney employees who put pressure on company head Chapek to take a stand. Pushing Disney into a more heated political landscape, the company took greater risks in the name of inclusivity and diversity. \"They have pressure from within the company to do it. So we have a lot of artists coming in and saying, You have to stand up for this,\" author and screenwriter Andrew Klavan said during the Fox Nation special. \"They are completely sequestered from ordinary people. They do not know the audience anymore.\"",

      "content": " The Biden administration’s reported consideration of reinstating family detention for migrants at the southern border marks the latest shift to the center by the administration — which has as a result come under heavy fire from left-wing groups for its moves to secure the border. Multiple outlets reported on Monday that the administration is considering reviving the detention of migrant families who cross the border illegally. Such a move would mark a significant reversal for the administration — which ended the practice in 2021 and instead released migrant family units into the U.S. interior with notices to appear in court or report to an Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) office. A Department of Homeland Security spokesperson said in a statement that \"no decisions have been made as we prepare for the Title 42 Public Health Order to lift.\" The spokesperson was referring to the coming end to Title 42, a Trump-era order implemented at the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic which allows for the rapid expulsion of migrants at the southern border for public health reasons. That order is ending on May 11 along with the ending of the COVID-19 public health emergency, and has renewed fresh concerns about a massive spike in migration when the expulsions end. The administration said last year that it believed that migrant encounter numbers could reach up to 14,000 a day when the order lifts. That would be on top of what have been historic numbers for the time of year, with 156,000 migrant encounters in January after the 251,000 in December — which marked a new record for any month. But with the order finally ending, the administration has been taking stricter measures at the border. Alongside a humanitarian parole program that allows 30,000 migrants from Venezuela, Nicaragua, Cuba and Haiti in each month, the administration in January expanded Title 42 expulsions to include those nationalities. Those expulsions are expected to continue until Title 8 authorities after May. The administration noted that, despite the high numbers in January, they were significantly lower than December — which officials tied to the new measures.",

The announcement comes on the eve of International Women’s Day. The EU move will see asset freezes and travel bans imposed on the nine, and an asset freeze slapped on Qarchak Prison — one of the Iranian regime’s detention facilities for women — as well as on Syria’s Republican Guard and a Myanmar army institution. Among those targeted are two acting Taliban government ministers accused of issuing decrees that restrict the rights of women and girls. The Taliban have imposed harsh measures since taking power in August 2021. They have banned women from public life and education for girls beyond the sixth grade. The EU also took aim at the head of Moscow Police Station, Lieutenant Colonel Alexander Georgievich Fedorinov, and one of his men. The commander is accused of authorizing \"the arbitrary arrest and detention, as well as the subsequent torture, of female anti-war protestors.\"",

However, Carney vetoed a marijuana legalization bill last year.(JIM WATSON/AFP via Getty Images) Democratic Gov. John Carney vetoed a legalization bill last year, and House members failed to muster the three-fifths majority needed to override the veto. Legalization is a necessary prerequisite for establishing a state-licensed and regulated marijuana industry. Supporters argue that a state-regulated industry would reduce illegal black-market sales, create jobs and generate more tax revenue. They said the legalization bill would not allow people to grow marijuana and wouldn't change laws on impaired driving or bar employers from having zero-tolerance policies. Opponents argue that legalization will lead to increased marijuana use among teens and young adults and expressed fears Tuesday about young people's cognitive development and possible prenatal exposure. They also said it would expose business owners to liability and lead to more traffic deaths and injuries. Legalization requires only a simple majority in both chambers, but the industry-creation bill will require a three-fifths majority because it creates a new tax in the form of a 15% levy on retail sales. The measure failed to gain approval last year and remains in committee this year. The Delaware House vote took place on the same day Oklahoma voters head to the polls to decide whether to approve allowing those over the age of 21 to purchase and possess up to 1 ounce of marijuana, plus concentrates and marijuana-infused products, and legally grow up to 12 marijuana plants.

NEWYou can now listen to Fox News articles! Our country recently received a sobering wakeup call with China’s spy balloon hovering over our skies. The blatant violation of American sovereignty wasn’t just an off-hand stunt, it was emblematic of Communist China’s view that they can get away with any aggressive actions against America with little consequences. The Chinese Communist Party (CCP) cares first and foremost about displacing the United States from its perch among the world’s powers, and this is particularly true when it comes to powering the world. As the Biden administration continues to shift American energy policy away from fossil fuels and toward green alternatives, it’s playing right into China’s hands. More specifically, China’s clean energy supremacy should be viewed as a direct threat to the United States. China controls large parts of the supply chains for critical minerals (e.g., copper, nickel, and lithium) and rare earth elements. These materials are absolutely crucial to clean energy technologies, like electric vehicles and solar panels, as well as a range of essential products from smartphones to fighter jets.",

The 2014 disappearance remains one of the most vexing mysteries in aviation. The Boeing 777 took off from Kuala Lumpur headed to Beijing March 8, 2014 and disappeared around 90 seconds after leaving Malaysian airspace with all 239 of its passengers seemingly gone without a trace. A multiyear search ensued, and with it a confusing and convoluted series of revelations and investigations that, to this day, have turned up no real conclusion. Malaysian authorities called off the search after three years, and subsequent search efforts have remained short-lived. The families of the missing have pushed for a renewed search, citing advances in technology that could help locate the bulk of the plane or any new evidence that could help them find closure.

(Joshua Paul/NurPhoto/NurPhoto/Corbis via Getty Images) \"While the next of kin of the passengers and crew on board attempt to rebuild our lives, the threat to global aviation safety remains a live issue,\" Voice370, a group of relatives of passengers from MH370, said in a statement. \"As long as we remain in the dark about what happened to MH370, we will never be able to prevent a similar tragedy. Accordingly, we believe that it is a matter of paramount importance that the search for MH370 is carried out to its completion.\"",

Fox News host Sean Hannity broke down new revelations surrounding security preparations leading up to January 6 and says elected leaders regardless of party affiliation should be safe and protected. SEAN HANNITY:Sadly, Democrats are not interested in learning how the Capitol is breached, why security failed so badly. But here's the saddest part to me, and it should be to the whole country. And that is this whole saga is the buried key and important information that we now know about intelligence that they had that was being ignored in the lead up to January 6. And they should have come up with a comprehensive security plan to ensure this could never, ever happen again. Like securing a perimeter, kind of like at the White House. You know, they have those concrete barriers that prevent you from getting on 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue. Then they have the big wrought iron fencing. We should all agree on this point. This is not a political point. Protecting our institutions like our Capitol. And every elected official, regardless of party. It needs to be a top priority. But for Democrats and others, politicizing something, in this case, smearing Donald Trump was the only thing that seemed to matter to that committee. Most Americans want our elected officials, regardless of what their party affiliation is, to be safe and protected. This needs to transcend politics. You would think this is something Democrats, Republicans should be, you know, protecting together. And by the way, that would also include Supreme Court justices. They should be protected. There are laws against people protesting in front of their homes, but we're not enforcing those laws. For many Democratic politicians, a violent riot is a political opportunity. Why? I guess they think they can rally their base or certainly they don't want to alienate their base. And maybe that's why they weren't and aren't focused on very real security failures at the Capitol on January 6. Or maybe it's because a prominent Democrat is to blame for those security failures, according to the former Capitol Police chief Steven Sund, who will join us in a minute.",

I got some supporters here and he's wasting no time proposing a list of things to make America great again. So what's his bold national vision for America? How about brand new cities on government land and would the objective be a quantum leap in the American standard of living? DONALD TRUMP:Our objective will be a quantum leap in the American standard of living. Almost one-third of the land mass of the United States is owned by the federal government. We should hold a contest to charter up to ten new cities and award them to the best proposals for development, a new shot at homeownership. And, in fact, the American dream. You want bold? That's bold. As bold as using hot sauce to treat herpes. That's not a suggestion. Some people learn the hard way. We keep hearing about affordable housing, but no one really ever has a handle on it. And that's because our cities aren't built for adding that to the mix. Cities are now for the elites and their therapists. So it's time for new towns, planned wisely, from the ground up.

A bill that would criminalize transgender people using restrooms that match their gender identity won initial approval in the Arkansas Legislature on Tuesday, introducing a restriction critics said would be the most extreme in the country. The bill approved by the majority-Republican Senate on a 19-7 vote would allow someone to be charged with misdemeanor sexual indecency with a child if they use a public restroom or changing room of the opposite sex when a minor is present. The bill now heads to the majority-GOP House. The legislation goes even further than a North Carolina bathroom law that was enacted in 2016 and later repealed following widespread boycotts and protests. That law did not include any criminal penalties. \"What this is is an attack on the continued existence in public of transgender people, and the criminalization of being transgender in public,\" said Cathryn Oakley, state legislative director and senior counsel at the Human Rights Campaign. The bill comes amidst a flood of bills targeting transgender people, and increasingly hostile rhetoric against trans people in statehouses. So far this year, at least 155 bills targeting trans people's rights have been introduced, according to the Human Rights Campaign.",

Sen. Jim Risch led a letter to Education Secretary Miguel Cardona on Wednesday morning, signed by 14 of his GOP colleagues, demanding to know \"to what extent\" federal dollars went toward programs and events that meet the International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance’s definition of antisemitism. \"We write with grave concern that the Department of Education, over the course of decades, has been allowing taxpayer-funded antisemitism to take place on college campuses throughout the United States,\" said the letter obtained by Fox News Digital. Senators are also asking what, if any, plans are in place to curb the rise of such discrimination and to make Jewish students enrolled in higher education feel at ease while at school. The letter was sent during a nationwide surge in antisemitic incidents in the U.S., which reached a historic high in 2021, according to the Anti-Defamation League (ADL). Sen.

Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com. Some Democrats are pushing former White House Chief of Staff Ron Klain to enter the 2024 Senate race in Indiana, but the Democratic candidate who was upset that the White House did not help more when he ran is speaking out. \"Quite frankly, you’re an jag-off for posting this Tweet Ron,\" former Indiana Democratic Senate nominee Thomas McDermott, Jr., wrote in a tweet. \"Neither you, or the National Dems lifted a finger to help any #Hoosier Dem win in the last election cycle. Now you post this? Get lost Ron.\" McDermott was responded to a tweet Klain sent calling for Indiana to find \"some great candidates\" to run for Senate in the state in 2024. To McDermott, Klain's tweet was tasteless, and he even suggested the ex-White House staffer, who left President Biden in January 2021, could be setting up his own for Senate. Following his departure from the White House, Indiana Democrats have pushed for Klain, in private and publicly, to enter the 2024 Senate race in the Hoosier State.",

President Ronald Reagan's audacious \"evil empire\" speech will be celebrated on Wednesday, March 8, 2023, in Washington, D.C. — 40 years to the day after the president issued a call to spiritual confrontation against communist doctrine and the Soviet Union. \"Reagan brought clarity, moral clarity to the Cold War with the Soviet Union,\" said Roger Zakheim, Washington director of the Ronald Reagan Presidential Foundation and Institute, told Fox News Digital. Zakheim’s organization is co-sponsoring a 40th anniversary symposium on March 8 hosted by The Victims of Communism Museum to honor the message of the \"evil empire\" speech and the man who delivered it. The group is also memorializing the more than 100 million people killed by communist leaders over the past century, from the purges of Soviet Premier Josef Stalin in the 1930s to Chairman Mao Zedong's Cultural Revolution in China in the 1960s and 1970s. Their effort to honor Reagan's leadership comes at a time when voices on both sides of the American political spectrum say that communist China poses an ever-growing threat to national liberty and sovereignty; and as the United States is funding Ukraine's war against Russia and its leader, former communist party agent Vladimir Putin.",

The lab leak theory, or the theory that the virus came from a leak at the Wuhan Institute of Virology in China, was widely dismissed as a conspiracy and \"fringe\" theory by liberal pundits and comedians alike. But in recent days, FBI Director Christopher Wray and the U.S. Energy Department have both indicated the virus likely started in the lab after all. Since the pandemic arrived in 2020, comedians on ABC, NBC and CBS have dismissed the theory, appearing not to take it seriously because it was pushed by the Trump administration. One of the most memorable pop culture moments related to the COVID pandemic came when former \"Daily Show\" host Jon Stewart appeared on \"The Late Show with Stephen Colbert\" in 2021. Stewart famously angered the media and stunned Colbert's audience – and appeared to surprise Colbert himself – when he embraced the lab leak theory. Stewart said the pandemic was \"more than likely caused by science,\" prompting Colbert to ask his longtime friend to elaborate. \"‘There’s a novel respiratory coronavirus overtaking Wuhan, China,'\" Stewart said. \"'What do we do?’ ‘Oh, you know who we could ask? The Wuhan novel respiratory coronavirus lab.’ The disease is the same name as the lab. That’s just a little too weird, don’t you think?\" \"‘Oh, my God, there’s been an outbreak of chocolaty goodness near Hershey, Pennsylvania. What do you think happened?'\" Stewart continued. \"Like, ‘Oh I don’t know, maybe a steam shovel mated with a cocoa bean?’ Or it’s the f---ing chocolate factory!\"",

Trump is one of four Republican candidates to announce a White House run, but many are watching DeSantis as he heads on Friday to Iowa, the state that kicks off the GOP presidential nominating calendar.

He also discusses congressional hearings on China and COVID origins. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell testified before a Senate committee Tuesday and warned that the Fed may raise rates higher later this month to curb inflation. On \"The Faulkner Focus\" Wednesday, Sen. John Kennedy, R-La., responded to Powell's testimony, arguing Powell understands the cost of President Biden's inflation to the job market but \"can't say it.\" JOHN KENNEDY:Chairman Powell is just doing his job. President Biden persists in saying that, my words not his, a honey bun costs $20 and your 401(k) is crashing because the economy is so good. No one believes that because it's not true and the American people aren't stupid. President Biden's inflation is pernicious. It is a cancer on the American dream, and we're not going to get it down without costing millions of people their jobs unless Congress helps on the fiscal side by reducing the rate of growth of spending and reducing the rate of growth of debt accumulation. And Powell knows that. He can't say it. And anyone who knows an economics textbook from an L.L. Bean catalog knows that. Powell stressed on Tuesday that central bank policymakers are prepared to raise interest rates higher than previously expected and pick up the pace of increases in the face of hotter-than-expected economic data. \"The latest economic data have come in stronger than expected, which suggests that the ultimate level of interest rates is likely to be higher than previously anticipated,\" Powell said in remarks prepared for delivery before the Senate Banking Committee. \"If the totality of the data were to indicate that faster tightening is warranted, we would be prepared to increase the pace of rate hikes.\" Central bankers are in the midst of the most aggressive campaign since the 1980s to crush persistently high inflation. Although the consumer price index has slowly fallen from a high of 9.1% notched in June, it remains about three times higher than the pre-pandemic average.",

The paper accused them of engaging in a \"populist rejection\" of pandemic measures that have left American’s public health institutions \"defanged\" and unprepared for a subsequent pandemic.

Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com. The Georgia Senate gave final approval Tuesday to a measure that could provide cash to extremely low-income pregnant women in the state, sending the measure to Gov. Brian Kemp for his signature. Senators voted 50-1 to pass House Bill 129, which was sought by the Republican governor. It would allow poor pregnant women to seek cash assistance under the state’s Temporary Assistance for Needy Families program before a child is born. But because of Georgia’s work requirements and long-frozen income guidelines, its unlikely to aid many people. Kemp and others say it’s another way Georgia can support women before and after birth, aiming to reduce the rate at which new mothers and babies die. It’s also driven in part by Georgia’s ban on abortion except in the earliest weeks of pregnancy. The state in November extended Medicaid coverage for new mothers for a year after birth. \"Georgia’s current standards are more restrictive than the federal government’s denying this assistance to pregnant women who are among the state’s neediest,\" said Sen. Mike Hodges, a Brunswick Republican and floor leader for Kemp. \"Expanding eligibility to pregnant women would continue to build on the steps Georgia has taken to improve maternal health for low income populations.\"",

My role is to be a facilitator to your hopes, wishes and dreams.\" \"He was speaking from the heart and to our child,\" Union commented to Variety. \"Hopefully speaking to our child, other parents will hear us.

As four Americans crossed from Brownsville, Texas, into the Mexican city of Matamoros, Tamaulipas, on Friday, their vehicle began receiving gunfire. Video from the incident showed who are presumed to be Mexican drug cartel members loading the victims into a vehicle, with two of them already appearing to have been dead or injured at the time as the attackers dragged their bodies. They were not thought to have been targets, but instead were initially caught between rival gangs’ crossfire. The White House has since referred to this crime as \"unacceptable.\" Fox News White House correspondent Peter Doocy addressed the spokeswoman at Tuesday’s press briefing and asked, \"So cartels kill Americans on this side of the border with drugs, and now they're killing Americans on the other side of the border with guns. Why is President Biden so comfortable with cartels operating so close to the U.S.?\" Jean-Pierre responded by claiming that fentanyl is currently at \"historic lows-historic levels\" under Biden’s presidency.

The House Foreign Affairs Committee will kick off its first hearing of the 118th Congress Wednesday examining the Biden administration's deadly withdrawal from Afghanistan in August 2021, which Republicans say was a \"stunning failure\" of leadership. The Taliban quickly took over Afghanistan's capital of Kabul in August 2021 as U.S. troops prepared to withdraw on Biden's orders, timed for the 20th anniversary of the 9/11 attacks. Thirteen U.S. service members and 170 others were killed during the withdrawal after a suicide bomber detonated explosives near Hamid Karzai International Airport in Kabul, and thousands of U.S. citizens and allies were left behind in the country overrun by the Taliban. According to a GOP committee aide, the purpose of the hearing is twofold – first, to serve as a \"scene setter\" and a reminder why the investigation is critical, and second, to allow veterans the chance to tell their stories and experiences on the ground during the withdrawal. Eighteen months later, many feel that same government has \"dismissed the trauma this caused,\" including by sweeping the whole thing under the rug, the aide told Fox News Digital, stressing the importance of the hearing Wednesday. \"What happened in Afghanistan was a systemic breakdown of the federal government at every level – and a stunning failure of leadership by the Biden administration,\" Chairman Michael McCaul, R-Texas, told Fox News Digital ahead of the hearing.

Nicole Malliotakis, R-N.Y., and Debbie Lesko, R-Ariz., on the upcoming first House hearing on COVID origins Ahead of a House hearing on the origins of COVID-19, the Biden administration's Department of Energy and the FBI have endorsed the COVID lab-leak theory in recent weeks. On \"Fox & Friends\" Wednesday, Rep. Nicole Malliotakis, R-N.Y., argued that the \"mounting evidence\" that Dr. Anthony Fauci was involved in \"one of the biggest cover-ups in American history.\" REP. NICOLE MALLIOTAKIS:That's the goal of this. For two years, the Democrats have stonewalled. They prohibited any hearing in this subcommittee to go after the origins of this virus. And if we don't know the origins, how we can prevent it from happening in the future? And it seems here that Dr. Fauci was involved in one of the biggest cover-ups in American history when he told us that it was not the lab leak, but instead, it was natural origins. And now we're finding out more and more that there is an email trail, there were conversations had with scientists, he actually pushed for a paper to be released that debunked the lab leak. But yet, now we're finding out from the various agencies in this administration that indeed what Republicans were saying all along and what we were accused of being conspiracy theorists for, that this lab leak did occur, is happening more and more. There's mounting evidence that there was a cover-up. And you know what? Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases. On Tuesday, Fauci and other health officials discussed the rollout of a vaccine shots while saying the shot could be similar to an annual flu shot. (Ting Shen/Bloomberg via Getty Images) As of last Monday, this administration, the White House itself has been denying that gain of function research was taking place. It still defends gain of function research, and it's denying that the lab leak occurred. So there are a lot of questions here. We want answers because as you mentioned, 1.1 million Americans died, that is nearly as many as the number of Americans that were killed in every war since the American Revolution combined. And so we will get the answers that the Democrats failed to do over the last two years.",

Only 15% of Americans hold a favorable view of China, according to a new national poll from Gallup. That’s a record low since Gallup started measuring American attitudes on China nearly 45 years ago, and the number marks a 5% drop over the past year, and nearly 40-point plunge since 2018. According to the poll released Monday, more than eight in ten adults in the U.S. hold a negative opinion of China, including 45% who view Beijing very unfavorably. \"Favorability of China was highest in early 1989, at 72%, but it fell to 34% later that year in the aftermath of the Tiananmen Square incident. From that point until 2017, China was viewed in a positive light by 33% to 50% of Americans. For just the third time in the trend, favorability rose to the majority level in 2018 (53%),\" Gallup noted. \"However, it fell to 41% in 2019, 33% in 2020, and 20% in 2012 and 2022 during the height of the COVID-19 pandemic.\" Chinese President Xi Jinping, also general secretary of the Communist Party of China Central Committee and chairman of the Central Military Commission, sits down with representatives of teachers and students at a symposium during a visit to Renmin University of China in Beijing, on April 25, 2022.

Steve Daines, the chair of the National Republican Senatorial Committee, is dismissing future political ambitions of retired U.S. Army Colonel Doug Mastriano, concluding that he is likely to not win a race after failing to clinch the post as governor of Pennsylvania in 2022. \"We need somebody who can win a primary and a general election. His last race demonstrated he can’t win a general,\" Daines said of Mastriano, according to one reporter. The comments from Daines come after Mastriano, who lost his bid for governor of Pennsylvania to Democrat Josh Shapiro in the November 2022 midterm elections, told Politico he is \"praying\" about a potential Senate run in 2024. \"We’ve seen people in the past, other Republican gubernatorial candidates, they rise and they disappear when they lose. Why? You have people that love you and support you,\" Mastriano told the outlet. Should he make a run for the Senate, Mastriano, as well as other Republican hopefuls who are sure to enter the race, would likely be running to take on incumbent Democratic Sen. Bob Casey, who is widely popular among voters in the state but has yet to announce whether he will seek a fourth term in office.",

EXCLUSIVE: A group of House Republicans introduced legislation Wednesday that would restrict California's ability to ban traditional gas-powered cars as part of the state's electric vehicle push. The four Republicans, led by Rep. Bob Latta of Ohio, said the bill — Preserving Choice in Vehicle Purchases Act — is designed to protect American consumers' freedom of choice and block stringent purchase requirements that would lead to higher costs. The legislation comes months after California, which leads the country in annual car sales, approved regulations mandating that all car purchases are \"zero emissions\" by 2035. \"We have seen time and time again that heavy-handed government intervention – like California’s proposal to ban internal combustion engine vehicles – limits consumer choice and infringes upon Americans’ freedoms when choosing what’s best for themselves and their families,\" Latta said in a statement shared with Fox News Digital. \"California’s misguided proposal will have ramifications that go well beyond its own borders and would make it more difficult for Americans to get to work, drop their kids off at school, and travel to visit loved ones,\" he continued. Latta, who serves as a senior member of the House Energy and Commerce Committee added that the legislation would help preserve consumers' freedom to choose vehicles they \"want – and can afford – to drive.\"",

No significant changes have been observed along the volcano’s rift zones. Scientists on Monday observed small \"ooze-outs\" of lava flowing sluggishly in the lava lake. The inside of the summit crater of Hawaii’s Kilauea volcano is seen on Jan. 5, 2023. The Kilauea volcano likely stopped erupting due to a large deflationary tilt drop in which the ground deflates.(U.S. Geological Survey via AP, File) Officials said activity diminished in the afternoon, and by Tuesday, there was no active lava in the crater. USGS said the reduction in activity was related to the \"larger deflationary tilt drop\" that began Feb. 17, a common process at Kilauea in which the ground deflates for hours or days. The drop in pressure can then cause eruptions to diminish. Kilauea began erupting again Jan. 5 after scientists detected a glow within Halemaumau Crater. The latest eruption started after a nearly monthlong pause in activity. Kilauea is one of the world’s most active volcanoes. A 2018 Kilauea eruption destroyed more than 700 homes.",

      "content": " Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni took office in October as Italy's first female prime minister Fox News senior foreign affairs correspondent Amy Kellogg provides details on the criticism facing Italian Prime Minister Meloni after more than 70 migrants, including some children, died while trying to reach the country. Migrant tragedies—deaths at sea—are all too familiar in this part of the world. But the demise of a rickety boat called \"Summer Love\" late last month struck a particularly painful chord. It happened close to Italy’s southern coast—the vessel packed with migrants broke into pieces less than 10 feet from shore in Calabria. Bodies washed up on the beach. Among the more than seventy dead were said to be 20 children and those souls recovered were laid out in a gym near where the disaster occurred in coffins, the children in small white ones. The stories of the dead—like that of a young mother from Pakistan who was desperately trying to reach Europe to obtain treatment for her disabled son—have touched people across the world. And now many, particularly here, are blaming the Italian government, saying its focus on stopping illegal or irregular migration has not stopped the phenomenon, but rather threatened life by hamstringing rescue crews who are now under new sets of regulations. Italy’s first female prime minister, Giorgia Meloni, has reacted angrily to suggestions that her government has not been adequately shaken by the tragedy of \"Summer Love\" and is guilty in some way for failing to prevent it, saying the maritime authorities did not have information about the ship being in peril before it was too late. The wreckage from a capsized boat washes ashore at a beach near Cutro, Italy, Sunday, Feb. 26, 2023. Rescue officials say an undetermined number of migrants have died and dozens have been rescued after their boat broke apart off southern Italy.(AP Photo/Giuseppe Pipita) \"I wonder if there is anyone in this nation who honestly believes that the government deliberately let over 60 people die including some children,\" Meloni said over the weekend, before the death toll climbed. \"I ask you, looking into your eyes, if any of you think that the Italian government could have saved 60 people, including a child of about 3 years whose body was discovered today, and did not do so. Please, let’s be serious.\"",

Fox News host Jesse Watters clarified Tuesday that he isn't calling for a hit against the Venezuelan national bird, the Troupial, but rather the Honduran scarlet macaw. Watters joked about evening the score against the national bird after two Honduran nationals — Ramiro Hernandez-Tziquin and Domingo Zetino-Hernandez, both 20 — were arrested last week after allegedly shooting and killing a North American bald eagle. The duo killed the national bird in Nebraska with the intention of eating it, according to local authorities. Bald Eagle close-up of head.(iStock)",

NEWYou can now listen to Fox News articles! The United States may have shot down one of Communist China’s spy balloons, but America’s problem of surveillance from foreign powers is far from destroyed. Many Americans were alarmed as we watched the Biden administration take a dangerously lazy approach to taking down the Chinese spy balloon. We are right to be upset about this, and demand action in response, but that balloon is just a small piece of Communist China’s massive surveillance effort targeting you, our military and American businesses. The harsh reality is that the Chinese Communist Party has been surveilling the United States for years using drones purchased with your taxpayer dollars and operated by your federal government.

More than 28 million people visited the region in 2022, a more than 50% jump compared with the previous year, according to the Caribbean Tourism Organization. \"It’s clearly apparent that even in the face of the devastating blows delivered by the pandemic, as a region, we have responded with hope, strength and determination to prevail,\" Kenneth Bryan, the organization’s chairman, said during a news conference in Barbados.

Pakistani police used water cannons and fired tear gas to disperse supporters of the country’s former Prime Minister Imran Khan Wednesday in the eastern city of Lahore. Two dozen Khan supporters were arrested for defying a government ban on holding rallies, police said. The developments followed Khan’s launching of provincial election campaigns Tuesday for eastern Punjab and northwest Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province provinces, where the ex-premier's Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf party has held a majority in past rounds of voting. Khan, now opposition leader, was ousted in a no-confidence vote in Parliament last April. He has claimed his removal was illegal and has also campaigned for early parlimentary elections. The government of his successor, Shahbaz Sharif, has dismissed Khan's demands, saying the nationwide vote will take place as scheduled later in the year. Fawad Chaudhry, another senior leader from Khan’s party, tweeted that the ban on protests was \"the new weapon of the fascist government\" of Sharif and its \"imperialist forces.\" \"The people of Pakistan have always fought for their rights,\" Chaudhry added.",
